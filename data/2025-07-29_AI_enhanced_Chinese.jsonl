The skin sensors employed in this study\npossess the capability to quantify multimodal tactile information at multiple\ncontact points. The time-series data generated from these sensors is\nanticipated to facilitate the classification of diverse contact motions\nexhibited by an operator. By mapping the classification results with robot\nmotion primitives, a diverse range of robot motions can be generated by\naltering the manner in which the skin sensors are interacted with. In this\npaper, we focus on a learning-based contact motion classifier employing\nrecurrent neural networks. This classifier is a pivotal factor in the success\nof this framework. Furthermore, we elucidate the requisite conditions for\nsoftware-hardware designs. Firstly, multimodal sensing and its comprehensive\nencoding significantly contribute to the enhancement of classification accuracy\nand learning stability. Utilizing all modalities simultaneously as inputs to\nthe classifier proves to be an effective approach. Secondly, it is essential to\nmount the skin sensors on a flexible and compliant support to enable the\nactivation of three-axis accelerometers. These accelerometers are capable of\nmeasuring horizontal tactile information, thereby enhancing the correlation\nwith other modalities. Furthermore, they serve to absorb the noises generated\nby the robot's movements during deployment.

However, most current\nsystems operate in an open-loop fashion, where LLMs act as one-shot planners,\nrendering them brittle and unable to adapt to unforeseen circumstances in\ndynamic physical environments. To overcome this limitation, this paper\nintroduces the \"Think, Act, Learn\" (T-A-L) framework, a novel architecture that\nenables an embodied agent to autonomously learn and refine its policies through\ncontinuous interaction. Our framework establishes a closed-loop cycle where an\nLLM first \"thinks\" by decomposing high-level commands into actionable plans.\nThe robot then \"acts\" by executing these plans while gathering rich, multimodal\nsensory feedback. Critically, the \"learn\" module processes this feedback to\nfacilitate LLM-driven self-reflection, allowing the agent to perform causal\nanalysis on its failures and generate corrective strategies. These insights are\nstored in an experiential memory to guide future planning cycles. We\ndemonstrate through extensive experiments in both simulation and the real world\nthat our T-A-L agent significantly outperforms baseline methods, including\nopen-loop LLMs, Behavioral Cloning, and traditional Reinforcement Learning.

To address\ninter- and intra-operator variability, robotic ultrasound systems have gained\nincreasing attention. However, their application in challenging intercostal\nimaging remains limited due to the lack of an effective scan path generation\nmethod within the constrained acoustic window. To overcome this challenge, we\nexplore the potential of tactile cues for characterizing subcutaneous rib\nstructures as an alternative signal for ultrasound segmentation-free bone\nsurface point cloud extraction. Compared to 2D US images, 1D tactile-related\nsignals offer higher processing efficiency and are less susceptible to acoustic\nnoise and artifacts. By leveraging robotic tracking data, a sparse tactile\npoint cloud is generated through a few scans along the rib, mimicking human\npalpation. To robustly map the scanning trajectory into the intercostal space,\nthe sparse tactile bone location point cloud is first interpolated to form a\ndenser representation. This refined point cloud is then registered to an\nimage-based dense bone surface point cloud, enabling accurate scan path mapping\nfor individual patients.

Deep learning models, predominantly based on\nneural networks (NNs), have demonstrated significant potential in modeling the\nvehicle dynamics and in performing various tasks in autonomous driving.\nHowever, their black-box nature is critical in the context of autonomous\nracing, where safety and robustness demand a thorough understanding of the\ndecision-making algorithms. To address this challenge, this paper proposes\nMS-NN-steer, a new Model-Structured Neural Network for vehicle steering\ncontrol, integrating the prior knowledge of the nonlinear vehicle dynamics into\nthe neural architecture.

Most existing work\nfocuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have\nexplored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts\nare restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and\nlack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,\nthis work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework\nof model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive\ncompensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,\nthe LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a\nreference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the\nunknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.\nExperiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided\nadaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive\ncontrol, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world\nenvironments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms\ntraditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity\ncompared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and\nreasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator\nenables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical\nderivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,\nadaptability, and robustness.

Variations in LiDAR types and\ndynamic elements lead to differences in point cloud distribution and scene\nconsistency, hindering reliable descriptor generation and loop closure\ndetection essential for accurate map alignment. To address these challenges,\nthis paper presents Uni-Mapper, a dynamic-aware 3D point cloud map merging\nframework for multi-modal LiDAR systems. It comprises dynamic object removal,\ndynamic-aware loop closure, and multi-modal LiDAR map merging modules. A\nvoxel-wise free space hash map is built in a coarse-to-fine manner to identify\nand reject dynamic objects via temporal occupancy inconsistencies. The removal\nmodule is integrated with a LiDAR global descriptor, which encodes preserved\nstatic local features to ensure robust place recognition in dynamic\nenvironments. In the final stage, multiple pose graph optimizations are\nconducted for both intra-session and inter-map loop closures. We adopt a\ncentralized anchor-node strategy to mitigate intra-session drift errors during\nmap merging. In the final stage, centralized anchor-node-based pose graph\noptimization is performed to address intra- and inter-map loop closures for\nglobally consistent map merging. Our framework is evaluated on diverse\nreal-world datasets with dynamic objects and heterogeneous LiDARs, showing\nsuperior performance in loop detection across sensor modalities, robust mapping\nin dynamic environments, and accurate multi-map alignment over existing\nmethods.

While prior research has focused\non fault detection via images or robotic platform design, the autonomous\nnavigation of robots within these structures is less explored. This study\naddresses that gap by proposing methods to detect navigable surfaces in truss\nstructures, enhancing the autonomy of climbing robots. The paper introduces\nseveral approaches for binary segmentation of navigable surfaces versus\nbackground from 3D point clouds of metallic trusses. These methods fall into\ntwo categories: analytical algorithms and deep learning models. The analytical\napproach features a custom algorithm that segments structures by analyzing the\neigendecomposition of planar patches in the point cloud. In parallel, advanced\ndeep learning models PointNet, PointNet++, MinkUNet34C, and PointTransformerV3\nare trained and evaluated for the same task. Comparative analysis shows that\nthe analytical algorithm offers easier parameter tuning and performance\ncomparable to deep learning models, which, while more computationally\nintensive, excel in segmentation accuracy. Notably, PointTransformerV3 achieves\na Mean Intersection Over Union (mIoU) of about 97%.

Our research introduces a neurosymbolic modular architecture for\nreactive robotics. Our system combines a neural component performing object\nrecognition over the environment and image processing techniques such as\noptical flow, with symbolic representation and reasoning. The reasoning system\nis grounded in the embodied cognition paradigm, via integrating image schematic\nknowledge in an ontological structure. The ontology is operatively used to\ncreate queries for the perception system, decide on actions, and infer\nentities' capabilities derived from perceptual data. The combination of\nreasoning and image processing allows the agent to focus its perception for\nnormal operation as well as discover new concepts for parts of objects involved\nin particular interactions. The discovered concepts allow the robot to\nautonomously acquire training data and adjust its subsymbolic perception to\nrecognize the parts, as well as making planning for more complex tasks feasible\nby focusing search on those relevant object parts. We demonstrate our approach\nin a simulated world, in which an agent learns to recognize parts of objects\ninvolved in support relations. While the agent has no concept of handle\ninitially, by observing examples of supported objects hanging from a hook it\nlearns to recognize the parts involved in establishing support and becomes able\nto plan the establishment/destruction of the support relation.

However, achieving human-like prediction and decision-making in\ninteractions with vulnerable road users remains a key challenge in complex\nmulti-agent interactive environments. Existing research focuses primarily on\ncrowd navigation for small mobile robots, which cannot be directly applied to\nAVs due to inherent differences in their decision-making strategies and dynamic\nboundaries. Moreover, pedestrians in these multi-agent simulations follow fixed\nbehavior patterns that cannot dynamically respond to AV actions. To overcome\nthese limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework for modeling\ninteractions between the AV and multiple pedestrians. In this framework, a\ncognitive process modeling approach inspired by the Free Energy Principle is\nintegrated into both the AV and pedestrian models to simulate more realistic\ninteraction dynamics. Specifically, the proposed pedestrian Cognitive-Risk\nSocial Force Model adjusts goal-directed and repulsive forces using a fused\nmeasure of cognitive uncertainty and physical risk to produce human-like\ntrajectories. Meanwhile, the AV leverages this fused risk to construct a\ndynamic, risk-aware adjacency matrix for a Graph Convolutional Network within a\nSoft Actor-Critic architecture, allowing it to make more reasonable and\ninformed decisions.
