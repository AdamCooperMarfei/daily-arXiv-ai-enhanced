### [1] [Research on UAV Applications in Public Administration: Based on an Improved RRT Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14096)
*Zhanxi Xie,Baili Lu,Yanzhao Gu,Zikun Li,Junhao Wei,Ngai Cheong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本研究提出改进的dRRT算法，通过四种策略优化无人机路径规划，在500m³城市环境中相比传统算法表现更优，成功率达100%，平均运行时间0.01468秒，路径更短更平滑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机从'技术工具'向'治理基础设施'转型，低空经济政策和智慧城市需求推动下，需要解决能耗、避障和空域限制等挑战，高效路径规划变得至关重要。

Method: 提出增强型快速探索随机树算法(dRRT)，包含四种策略：目标偏置(加速收敛)、动态步长(平衡探索与避障)、绕行优先(优先水平绕行而非垂直爬升)、B样条平滑(提升路径平滑度)。

Result: 在随机建筑物的500m³城市环境模拟中，dRRT相比传统RRT、A*和蚁群算法表现更优：100%成功率、平均运行时间0.01468秒、更短路径、更少航点、更平滑轨迹(最大偏航角<45度)。

Conclusion: dRRT在公共管理场景如应急响应和交通监控中具有高效部署潜力，但存在计算开销增加和目标偏置可能导致局部最优的局限性，需要与实时避障框架集成。该研究推动了城市治理、机器人和计算优化的跨学科发展。

Abstract: This study investigates the application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in
public management, focusing on optimizing path planning to address challenges
such as energy consumption, obstacle avoidance, and airspace constraints. As
UAVs transition from 'technical tools' to 'governance infrastructure', driven
by advancements in low-altitude economy policies and smart city demands,
efficient path planning becomes critical. The research proposes an enhanced
Rapidly-exploring Random Tree algorithm (dRRT), incorporating four strategies:
Target Bias (to accelerate convergence), Dynamic Step Size (to balance
exploration and obstacle navigation), Detour Priority (to prioritize horizontal
detours over vertical ascents), and B-spline smoothing (to enhance path
smoothness). Simulations in a 500 m3 urban environment with randomized
buildings demonstrate dRRT's superiority over traditional RRT, A*, and Ant
Colony Optimization (ACO). Results show dRRT achieves a 100\% success rate with
an average runtime of 0.01468s, shorter path lengths, fewer waypoints, and
smoother trajectories (maximum yaw angles <45{\deg}). Despite improvements,
limitations include increased computational overhead from added mechanisms and
potential local optima due to goal biasing. The study highlights dRRT's
potential for efficient UAV deployment in public management scenarios like
emergency response and traffic monitoring, while underscoring the need for
integration with real-time obstacle avoidance frameworks. This work contributes
to interdisciplinary advancements in urban governance, robotics, and
computational optimization.

### [2] [No More Marching: Learning Humanoid Locomotion for Short-Range SE(2) Targets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14098)
*Pranay Dugar,Mohitvishnu S. Gadde,Jonah Siekmann,Yesh Godse,Aayam Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于强化学习的人形机器人SE(2)目标位姿直接优化方法，通过星座式奖励函数实现更自然高效的短距离移动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习方法主要优化速度跟踪而非直接位姿到达，导致短距离任务时出现低效的"行进式"行为，需要更实用的短距离运动方案

Method: 开发强化学习方法，采用新的星座式奖励函数直接优化人形机器人对SE(2)目标的运动控制

Result: 在能耗、到达时间和步数等指标上均优于标准方法，并成功实现从仿真到硬件的迁移

Conclusion: 针对性的奖励设计对于实用的短距离人形机器人运动至关重要

Abstract: Humanoids operating in real-world workspaces must frequently execute
task-driven, short-range movements to SE(2) target poses. To be practical,
these transitions must be fast, robust, and energy efficient. While
learning-based locomotion has made significant progress, most existing methods
optimize for velocity-tracking rather than direct pose reaching, resulting in
inefficient, marching-style behavior when applied to short-range tasks. In this
work, we develop a reinforcement learning approach that directly optimizes
humanoid locomotion for SE(2) targets. Central to this approach is a new
constellation-based reward function that encourages natural and efficient
target-oriented movement. To evaluate performance, we introduce a benchmarking
framework that measures energy consumption, time-to-target, and footstep count
on a distribution of SE(2) goals. Our results show that the proposed approach
consistently outperforms standard methods and enables successful transfer from
simulation to hardware, highlighting the importance of targeted reward design
for practical short-range humanoid locomotion.

TL;DR: 基于接触模式的优化方法，统一计划人形机器人的移动和操作任务


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决任务、接触和运动规划的分割问题，实现人形机器人移动-操作任务的统一规划

Method: 通过接触模式变更定义符号动作，在包含全身动力学和约束的统一搜索空间中进行规划

Result: 能够生成广泛的物理一致的移动-操作行为，处理需要复杂推理的长序列任务

Conclusion: 首次实现了包含全身动力学和驱动约束的完全无环规划的人形机器人移动-操作问题解决方案

Abstract: This work presents an optimization-based task and motion planning (TAMP)
framework that unifies planning for locomotion and manipulation through a
shared representation of contact modes. We define symbolic actions as contact
mode changes, grounding high-level planning in low-level motion. This enables a
unified search that spans task, contact, and motion planning while
incorporating whole-body dynamics, as well as all constraints between the
robot, the manipulated object, and the environment. Results on a humanoid
platform show that our method can generate a broad range of physically
consistent loco-manipulation behaviors over long action sequences requiring
complex reasoning. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that
enables the resolution of an integrated TAMP formulation with fully acyclic
planning and whole body dynamics with actuation constraints for the humanoid
loco-manipulation problem.

### [4] [Domain Translation of a Soft Robotic Arm using Conditional Cycle Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14100)
*Nilay Kushawaha,Carlo Alessi,Lorenzo Fruzzetti,Egidio Falotico*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于条件循环生成对抗网络(CCGAN)的领域转换框架，实现软机器人从源领域到目标领域的知识迁移，解决了材料退化带来的控制挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软机器人材料随时间逐渐退化，传统分析方法需要精确的物理特性知识，而深度学习模型在不同物理特性的领域间无法直接迁移。

Method: 使用条件循环生成对抗网络(CCGAN)，通过动态学习方法将标准仿真环境中训练的姿态控制器适配到粘度增加十倍的领域，模型学习基于末端执行器位置和方向的输入压力信号。

Result: 在五种不同形状的轨迹跟踪实验中验证了方法的有效性，并在噪声扰动和周期性测试中表现出良好的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CCGAN-GP能够有效促进跨领域技能迁移，为开发更具适应性和泛化能力的软机器人控制器开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Deep learning provides a powerful method for modeling the dynamics of soft
robots, offering advantages over traditional analytical approaches that require
precise knowledge of the robot's structure, material properties, and other
physical characteristics. Given the inherent complexity and non-linearity of
these systems, extracting such details can be challenging. The mappings learned
in one domain cannot be directly transferred to another domain with different
physical properties. This challenge is particularly relevant for soft robots,
as their materials gradually degrade over time. In this paper, we introduce a
domain translation framework based on a conditional cycle generative
adversarial network (CCGAN) to enable knowledge transfer from a source domain
to a target domain. Specifically, we employ a dynamic learning approach to
adapt a pose controller trained in a standard simulation environment to a
domain with tenfold increased viscosity. Our model learns from input pressure
signals conditioned on corresponding end-effector positions and orientations in
both domains. We evaluate our approach through trajectory-tracking experiments
across five distinct shapes and further assess its robustness under noise
perturbations and periodicity tests. The results demonstrate that CCGAN-GP
effectively facilitates cross-domain skill transfer, paving the way for more
adaptable and generalizable soft robotic controllers.

### [5] [Efficient Environment Design for Multi-Robot Navigation via Continuous Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14105)
*Jahid Chowdhury Choton,John Woods,William Hsu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效可定制的多机器人导航环境，将连续控制的多机器人导航任务建模为MDP，并使用多种RL方法进行性能评估，在3D农业场景中验证了实际应用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人在连续状态和动作空间中的导航和路径规划在不确定环境中仍然是一个开放挑战。深度强化学习虽然流行，但存在样本效率低、训练时间长的问题，且现有工作缺乏形式化保证。

Method: 将多机器人导航任务建模为马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)，设计了一个高效可定制的环境，机器人需要沿最短路径访问感兴趣区域。使用了A2C、PPO、TRPO、TQC、CrossQ和ARS等梯度与非梯度RL方法进行性能评估，并在CoppeliaSim机器人模拟器的3D农业场景中进行部署验证。

Result: 开发了多个环境变体并测量了性能，展示了在有限资源和合理时间范围内使用现有最先进RL方法解决实际世界系统的能力。通过在学习模型上运行推理来测量鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该工作为研究人员提供了如何开发适用于实际世界系统的MDP基础环境，并使用现有最先进RL方法在有限资源和合理时间内解决问题的指导。

Abstract: Multi-robot navigation and path planning in continuous state and action
spaces with uncertain environments remains an open challenge. Deep
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is one of the most popular paradigms for solving
this task, but its real-world application has been limited due to sample
inefficiency and long training periods. Moreover, the existing works using RL
for multi-robot navigation lack formal guarantees while designing the
environment. In this paper, we introduce an efficient and highly customizable
environment for continuous-control multi-robot navigation, where the robots
must visit a set of regions of interest (ROIs) by following the shortest paths.
The task is formally modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). We describe
the multi-robot navigation task as an optimization problem and relate it to
finding an optimal policy for the MDP. We crafted several variations of the
environment and measured the performance using both gradient and non-gradient
based RL methods: A2C, PPO, TRPO, TQC, CrossQ and ARS. To show real-world
applicability, we deployed our environment to a 3-D agricultural field with
uncertainties using the CoppeliaSim robot simulator and measured the robustness
by running inference on the learned models. We believe our work will guide the
researchers on how to develop MDP-based environments that are applicable to
real-world systems and solve them using the existing state-of-the-art RL
methods with limited resources and within reasonable time periods.

### [6] [SimGenHOI: Physically Realistic Whole-Body Humanoid-Object Interaction via Generative Modeling and Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14120)

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了人形机器人-物体交互生成中的物理真实性问题，通过生成建模和强化学习的结合实现了高质量的运动生成和控制。

Abstract: Generating physically realistic humanoid-object interactions (HOI) is a
fundamental challenge in robotics. Existing HOI generation approaches, such as
diffusion-based models, often suffer from artifacts such as implausible
contacts, penetrations, and unrealistic whole-body actions, which hinder
successful execution in physical environments. To address these challenges, we
introduce SimGenHOI, a unified framework that combines the strengths of
generative modeling and reinforcement learning to produce controllable and
physically plausible HOI. Our HOI generative model, based on Diffusion
Transformers (DiT), predicts a set of key actions conditioned on text prompts,
object geometry, sparse object waypoints, and the initial humanoid pose. These
key actions capture essential interaction dynamics and are interpolated into
smooth motion trajectories, naturally supporting long-horizon generation. To
ensure physical realism, we design a contact-aware whole-body control policy
trained with reinforcement learning, which tracks the generated motions while
correcting artifacts such as penetration and foot sliding. Furthermore, we
introduce a mutual fine-tuning strategy, where the generative model and the
control policy iteratively refine each other, improving both motion realism and
tracking robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimGenHOI generates
realistic, diverse, and physically plausible humanoid-object interactions,
achieving significantly higher tracking success rates in simulation and
enabling long-horizon manipulation tasks. Code will be released upon acceptance
on our project page: https://xingxingzuo.github.io/simgen_hoi.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文研究基于牛顿-拉弗森流方法的轻量级跟踪控制器在小型飞艇和中型四旋翼上的实际性能，与反馈线性化和非线性模型预测控制等基准方法相比，在保持相当或更好跟踪性能的同时显著降低了计算时间和能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究轻量级跟踪控制器在真实空中硬件平台上的性能，这些平台面临实际部署和机载计算约束，需要验证该技术在现实环境中的有效性。

Method: 采用基于牛顿-拉弗森流方法的跟踪控制器，在小型飞艇和中型四旋翼上进行真实飞行实验，与反馈线性化（飞艇）和非线性模型预测控制（两者）进行对比分析。

Result: 实验结果表明，牛顿-拉弗森流跟踪控制器在飞行轨迹均方根误差方面达到相当或优于基准方法的性能，同时计算时间显著减少，CPU能耗大幅降低。

Conclusion: 该轻量级跟踪控制器在实际空中机器人应用中具有显著优势，能够在保持良好跟踪性能的同时大幅降低计算资源需求，适合资源受限的机载系统。

Abstract: We investigate the performance of a lightweight tracking controller, based on
a flow version of the Newton-Raphson method, applied to a miniature blimp and a
mid-size quadrotor. This tracking technique has been shown to enjoy theoretical
guarantees of performance and has been applied with success in simulation
studies and on mobile robots with simple motion models. This paper investigates
the technique through real-world flight experiments on aerial hardware
platforms subject to realistic deployment and onboard computational
constraints. The technique's performance is assessed in comparison with the
established control frameworks of feedback linearization for the blimp, and
nonlinear model predictive control for both quadrotor and blimp. The
performance metrics under consideration are (i) root mean square error of
flight trajectories with respect to target trajectories, (ii) algorithms'
computation times, and (iii) CPU energy consumption associated with the control
algorithms. The experimental findings show that the Newton-Raphson flow-based
tracking controller achieves comparable or superior tracking performance to the
baseline methods with substantially reduced computation time and energy
expenditure.

*Omar Mostafa,Nikolaos Evangeliou,Anthony Tzes*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种面向圆形足迹机器人的2D探索策略，使用安全骨架方法保持与障碍物最大距离，优先考虑安全性并探索未检测空间


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对无法瞬时控制姿态的经典圆形足迹机器人，在障碍物密集的平面空间中实现安全有效的探索，而非使用可瞬时调整位置和高度的点机器人

Method: 采用自平衡双轮差速驱动系统，配备IMU、3D-LiDAR和RGB-D相机。使用RTAB-SLAM进行定位建图，通过安全骨架方法将机器人置于离静态障碍物最远的位置，朝向空间开口方向探索

Result: 通过ROS移动机器人进行了实验研究，展示了在空间探索过程中的路径规划策略

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了在障碍物密集环境中的安全探索，优先保障机器人安全的同时有效探索未探测区域

Abstract: This paper suggests a 2D exploration strategy for a planar space cluttered
with obstacles. Rather than using point robots capable of adjusting their
position and altitude instantly, this research is tailored to classical agents
with circular footprints that cannot control instantly their pose. Inhere, a
self-balanced dual-wheeled differential drive system is used to explore the
place. The system is equipped with linear accelerometers and angular
gyroscopes, a 3D-LiDAR, and a forward-facing RGB-D camera. The system performs
RTAB-SLAM using the IMU and the LiDAR, while the camera is used for loop
closures. The mobile agent explores the planar space using a safe skeleton
approach that places the agent as far as possible from the static obstacles.
During the exploration strategy, the heading is towards any offered openings of
the space. This space exploration strategy has as its highest priority the
agent's safety in avoiding the obstacles followed by the exploration of
undetected space. Experimental studies with a ROS-enabled mobile agent are
presented indicating the path planning strategy while exploring the space.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过分析蜻蜴空中调整反射运动轨迹，将生物行为转化为空间操纵器系统的控制策略，提高微重力环境下的机动性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决空间操纵器系统在微重力环境下的控制挑战，特别是操纵器与定子基底之间的动力耦合问题。

Conclusion: 生物反射行为可以成功转化为空间操纵器系统的控制策略，为未来任务的机动性和稳健性提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic arms mounted on spacecraft, known as space manipulator systems
(SMSs), are critical for enabling on-orbit assembly, satellite servicing, and
debris removal. However, controlling these systems in microgravity remains a
significant challenge due to the dynamic coupling between the manipulator and
the spacecraft base. This study explores the potential of using biological
inspiration to address this issue, focusing on animals, particularly lizards,
that exhibit mid-air righting reflexes. Based on similarities between SMSs and
these animals in terms of behavior, morphology, and environment, their
air-righting motion trajectories are extracted from high-speed video recordings
using computer vision techniques. These trajectories are analyzed within a
multi-objective optimization framework to identify the key behavioral goals and
assess their relative importance. The resulting motion profiles are then
applied as reference trajectories for SMS control, with baseline controllers
used to track them. The findings provide a step toward translating evolved
animal behaviors into interpretable, adaptive control strategies for space
robotics, with implications for improving maneuverability and robustness in
future missions.

Motivation: LiDAR-惯性里程计在复杂环境中的定位和建图至关重要，但LiDAR特征退化问题严重影响了状态估计的可靠性，需要开发更鲁棒的解决方案。

Method: 采用自适应异常值去除阈值（根据点传感器距离和平台运动幅度动态调整），结合灵活的扫描到子图配准方法，并设计新型权重矩阵融合IMU预积分协方差和退化度量。

Result: 在室内外稀疏或退化特征环境中的大量实验表明，该方法在鲁棒性和精度方面均优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 所提出的增强型LIO框架通过自适应异常值处理和扫描到子图配准策略，有效解决了特征退化问题，为复杂环境下的可靠定位提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: LiDAR-inertial odometry (LIO) plays a vital role in achieving accurate
localization and mapping, especially in complex environments. However, the
presence of LiDAR feature degeneracy poses a major challenge to reliable state
estimation. To overcome this issue, we propose an enhanced LIO framework that
integrates adaptive outlier-tolerant correspondence with a scan-to-submap
registration strategy. The core contribution lies in an adaptive outlier
removal threshold, which dynamically adjusts based on point-to-sensor distance
and the motion amplitude of platform. This mechanism improves the robustness of
feature matching in varying conditions. Moreover, we introduce a flexible
scan-to-submap registration method that leverages IMU data to refine pose
estimation, particularly in degenerate geometric configurations. To further
enhance localization accuracy, we design a novel weighting matrix that fuses
IMU preintegration covariance with a degeneration metric derived from the
scan-to-submap process. Extensive experiments conducted in both indoor and
outdoor environments-characterized by sparse or degenerate features-demonstrate
that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms
of both robustness and accuracy.

Motivation: 在机器人控制和资源分配等安全关键应用中，动作约束下的策略学习至关重要。传统模仿学习无法处理专家与模仿者动作空间不匹配的问题，导致占用度量不匹配。

Abstract: Policy learning under action constraints plays a central role in ensuring
safe behaviors in various robot control and resource allocation applications.
In this paper, we study a new problem setting termed Action-Constrained
Imitation Learning (ACIL), where an action-constrained imitator aims to learn
from a demonstrative expert with larger action space. The fundamental challenge
of ACIL lies in the unavoidable mismatch of occupancy measure between the
expert and the imitator caused by the action constraints. We tackle this
mismatch through \textit{trajectory alignment} and propose DTWIL, which
replaces the original expert demonstrations with a surrogate dataset that
follows similar state trajectories while adhering to the action constraints.
Specifically, we recast trajectory alignment as a planning problem and solve it
via Model Predictive Control, which aligns the surrogate trajectories with the
expert trajectories based on the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that learning from the dataset generated
by DTWIL significantly enhances performance across multiple robot control tasks
and outperforms various benchmark imitation learning algorithms in terms of
sample efficiency. Our code is publicly available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Fair-CoPlan是一个用于城市空中交通的公平协商式飞行规划器，通过运营商和服务提供商合作计算公平的飞行路径，在保证安全的同时实现路径长度的公平分配


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前飞行规划器可能导致某些无人机获得不成比例的较短飞行路径，而牺牲其他无人机的利益，需要一种公平的方式来优化飞行路径分配

Method: 采用三步法：1)服务提供商基于垂直起降场容量约束起降选择；2)运营商在约束下独立规划；3)服务提供商解决路径冲突，优化路径长度公平性

Result: 实验表明Fair-CoPlan比非公平规划器产生更公平的结果，以轻微延迟为代价实现更好的公平性

Conclusion: Fair-CoPlan通过公平分摊冲突解决成本，鼓励更广泛的参与，确保空域安全，并提升运营商灵活性

Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) is an emerging transportation paradigm in which
Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) autonomously transport passengers and goods in
cities. The UAS have different operators with different, sometimes competing
goals, yet must share the airspace. We propose a negotiated, semi-distributed
flight planner that optimizes UAS' flight lengths {\em in a fair manner}.
Current flight planners might result in some UAS being given disproportionately
shorter flight paths at the expense of others. We introduce Fair-CoPlan, a
planner in which operators and a Provider of Service to the UAM (PSU) together
compute \emph{fair} flight paths. Fair-CoPlan has three steps: First, the PSU
constrains take-off and landing choices for flights based on capacity at and
around vertiports. Then, operators plan independently under these constraints.
Finally, the PSU resolves any conflicting paths, optimizing for path length
fairness. By fairly spreading the cost of deconfliction Fair-CoPlan encourages
wider participation in UAM, ensures safety of the airspace and the areas below
it, and promotes greater operator flexibility. We demonstrate Fair-CoPlan
through simulation experiments and find fairer outcomes than a non-fair planner
with minor delays as a trade-off.

Motivation: 当机器人存在竞争利益时，需要优化资源使用的公平性，特别是在能量消耗方面实现公平分配，同时保证任务成功。

Method: 制定分布式公平运动规划器，并与安全控制器集成，形成FiReFly算法。算法关注机器人能量消耗的公平分布。

Result: 在模拟到达规避任务中，FiReFly相比非公平规划器产生了更公平的轨迹，提高了任务成功率。实时性能可达15架无人机，扩展到50架无人机需要在运行时间和公平性改进之间权衡。

Conclusion: FiReFly算法成功实现了多机器人运动规划中的公平性优化，在保证任务成功的同时改善了能量消耗的公平分配，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: We propose injecting notions of fairness into multi-robot motion planning.
When robots have competing interests, it is important to optimize for some kind
of fairness in their usage of resources. In this work, we explore how the
robots' energy expenditures might be fairly distributed among them, while
maintaining mission success. We formulate a distributed fair motion planner and
integrate it with safe controllers in a algorithm called FiReFly. For simulated
reach-avoid missions, FiReFly produces fairer trajectories and improves mission
success rates over a non-fair planner. We find that real-time performance is
achievable up to 15 UAVs, and that scaling up to 50 UAVs is possible with
trade-offs between runtime and fairness improvements.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效缓解离线模仿学习中的数据限制问题，通过动态表征预训练显著提升小数据场景下的性能

Abstract: Limited data has become a major bottleneck in scaling up offline imitation
learning (IL). In this paper, we propose enhancing IL performance under limited
expert data by introducing a pre-training stage that learns dynamics
representations, derived from factorizations of the transition dynamics. We
first theoretically justify that the optimal decision variable of offline IL
lies in the representation space, significantly reducing the parameters to
learn in the downstream IL. Moreover, the dynamics representations can be
learned from arbitrary data collected with the same dynamics, allowing the
reuse of massive non-expert data and mitigating the limited data issues. We
present a tractable loss function inspired by noise contrastive estimation to
learn the dynamics representations at the pre-training stage. Experiments on
MuJoCo demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can mimic expert policies with
as few as a single trajectory. Experiments on real quadrupeds show that we can
leverage pre-trained dynamics representations from simulator data to learn to
walk from a few real-world demonstrations.

Abstract: Online coordination of multi-robot systems in open and unknown environments
faces significant challenges, particularly when semantic features detected
during operation dynamically trigger new tasks. Recent large language model
(LLMs)-based approaches for scene reasoning and planning primarily focus on
one-shot, end-to-end solutions in known environments, lacking both dynamic
adaptation capabilities for online operation and explainability in the
processes of planning. To address these issues, a novel framework (DEXTER-LLM)
for dynamic task planning in unknown environments, integrates four modules: (i)
a mission comprehension module that resolves partial ordering of tasks
specified by natural languages or linear temporal logic formulas (LTL); (ii) an
online subtask generator based on LLMs that improves the accuracy and
explainability of task decomposition via multi-stage reasoning; (iii) an
optimal subtask assigner and scheduler that allocates subtasks to robots via
search-based optimization; and (iv) a dynamic adaptation and human-in-the-loop
verification module that implements multi-rate, event-based updates for both
subtasks and their assignments, to cope with new features and tasks detected
online. The framework effectively combines LLMs' open-world reasoning
capabilities with the optimality of model-based assignment methods,
simultaneously addressing the critical issue of online adaptability and
explainability. Experimental evaluations demonstrate exceptional performances,
with 100% success rates across all scenarios, 160 tasks and 480 subtasks
completed on average (3 times the baselines), 62% less queries to LLMs during
adaptation, and superior plan quality (2 times higher) for compound tasks.

Conclusion: FBI框架通过动态融合视觉和触觉模态，有效解决了灵巧手内操作的挑战，在多个任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation is a long-standing challenge in robotics due
to complex contact dynamics and partial observability. While humans synergize
vision and touch for such tasks, robotic approaches often prioritize one
modality, therefore limiting adaptability. This paper introduces Flow Before
Imitation (FBI), a visuotactile imitation learning framework that dynamically
fuses tactile interactions with visual observations through motion dynamics.
Unlike prior static fusion methods, FBI establishes a causal link between
tactile signals and object motion via a dynamics-aware latent model. FBI
employs a transformer-based interaction module to fuse flow-derived tactile
features with visual inputs, training a one-step diffusion policy for real-time
execution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms the baseline methods in both simulation and the real world on two
customized in-hand manipulation tasks and three standard dexterous manipulation
tasks. Code, models, and more results are available in the website

Track in the ICRA 2025 What Bimanuals Can Do (WBCD) competition. We tackled a
series of demanding tasks under strict requirements for speed, precision, and
reliability: unfolding a tablecloth (deformable-object manipulation), placing a

with the lid. Our solution combines VR-based teleoperation and Learning from
Demonstrations (LfD) to balance robustness and autonomy. Most subtasks were
executed through high-fidelity remote teleoperation, while the pizza placement
was handled by an ACT-based policy trained from 100 in-person teleoperated
demonstrations with randomized initial configurations. By carefully integrating
scoring rules, task characteristics, and current technical capabilities, our
approach achieved both high efficiency and reliability, ultimately securing the
first place in the competition.

Abstract: To address the challenges of localization drift and perception-planning
coupling in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in open-top scenarios
(e.g., collapsed buildings, roofless mazes), this paper proposes EAROL, a novel
framework with a downward-mounted tilted LiDAR configuration (20{\deg}

hierarchical trajectory-yaw optimization algorithm. The hardware innovation
enables constraint enhancement via dense ground point cloud acquisition and
forward environmental awareness for dynamic obstacle detection. A
tightly-coupled LIO system, empowered by an Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(IESKF) with dynamic motion compensation, achieves high level 6-DoF
localization accuracy in feature-sparse environments. The planner, augmented by
environment, balancing environmental exploration, target tracking precision,
and energy efficiency. Physical experiments demonstrate 81% tracking error
reduction, 22% improvement in perceptual coverage, and near-zero vertical drift
across indoor maze and 60-meter-scale outdoor scenarios. This work proposes a
hardware-algorithm co-design paradigm, offering a robust solution for UAV
autonomy in post-disaster search and rescue missions. We will release our

Abstract: Despite extensive developments in motion planning of autonomous aerial
vehicles (AAVs), existing frameworks faces the challenges of local minima and
deadlock in complex dynamic environments, leading to increased collision risks.
To address these challenges, we present TRUST-Planner, a topology-guided
hierarchical planning framework for robust spatial-temporal obstacle avoidance.
In the frontend, a dynamic enhanced visible probabilistic roadmap (DEV-PRM) is
proposed to rapidly explore topological paths for global guidance. The backend
utilizes a uniform terminal-free minimum control polynomial (UTF-MINCO) and
dynamic distance field (DDF) to enable efficient predictive obstacle avoidance
and fast parallel computation. Furthermore, an incremental multi-branch
trajectory management framework is introduced to enable spatio-temporal
topological decision-making, while efficiently leveraging historical
information to reduce replanning time. Simulation results show that
TRUST-Planner outperforms baseline competitors, achieving a 96\% success rate
and millisecond-level computation efficiency in tested complex environments.
Real-world experiments further validate the feasibility and practicality of the
proposed method.

Abstract: The ability to coordinate actions across multiple agents is critical for
solving complex, real-world problems. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
strong capabilities in communication, planning, and reasoning, raising the
question of whether they can also support effective collaboration in
multi-agent settings. In this work, we investigate the use of LLM agents to
solve a structured victim rescue task that requires division of labor,
prioritization, and cooperative planning. Agents operate in a fully known
graph-based environment and must allocate resources to victims with varying
needs and urgency levels. We systematically evaluate their performance using a
suite of coordination-sensitive metrics, including task success rate, redundant
actions, room conflicts, and urgency-weighted efficiency. This study offers new
insights into the strengths and failure modes of LLMs in physically grounded
multi-agent collaboration tasks, contributing to future benchmarks and
architectural improvements.

Abstract: Mobile robot platforms are increasingly being used to automate information
gathering tasks such as environmental monitoring. Efficient target tracking in
dynamic environments is critical for applications such as search and rescue and
pollutant cleanups. In this letter, we study active mapping of floating targets
that drift due to environmental disturbances such as wind and currents. This is
a challenging problem as it involves predicting both spatial and temporal
variations in the map due to changing conditions. We propose an informative
path planning framework to map an arbitrary number of moving targets with
initially unknown positions in dynamic environments. A key component of our
approach is a spatiotemporal prediction network that predicts target position
distributions over time. We propose an adaptive planning objective for target
tracking that leverages these predictions. Simulation experiments show that our
proposed planning objective improves target tracking performance compared to
existing methods that consider only entropy reduction as the planning
objective. Finally, we validate our approach in field tests using an autonomous
surface vehicle, showcasing its ability to track targets in real-world
monitoring scenarios.

Abstract: Aiming to enhance the consistency and thus long-term accuracy of Extended
Kalman Filters for terrestrial vehicle localization, this paper introduces the
Manifold Error State Extended Kalman Filter (M-ESEKF). By representing the
robot's pose in a space with reduced dimensionality, the approach ensures
feasible estimates on generic smooth surfaces, without introducing artificial
constraints or simplifications that may degrade a filter's performance. The
accompanying measurement models are compatible with common loosely- and
tightly-coupled sensor modalities and also implicitly account for the ground
geometry. We extend the formulation by introducing a novel correction scheme
that embeds additional domain knowledge into the sensor data, giving more
accurate uncertainty approximations and further enhancing filter consistency.
The proposed estimator is seamlessly integrated into a validated modular state
estimation framework, demonstrating compatibility with existing
implementations. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations across diverse scenarios and
dynamic sensor configurations show that the M-ESEKF outperforms classical
filter formulations in terms of consistency and stability. Moreover, it
eliminates the need for scenario-specific parameter tuning, enabling its
application in a variety of real-world settings.

Abstract: Labor shortages have severely affected the meat processing sector. Automated
technology has the potential to support the meat industry, assist workers, and
enhance job quality. However, existing automation in meat processing is highly
specialized, inflexible, and cost intensive. Instead of forcing manufacturers
to buy a separate device for each step of the process, our objective is to
develop general-purpose robotic systems that work alongside humans to perform
multiple meat processing tasks. Through a recently conducted survey of industry
experts, we identified two main challenges associated with integrating these
collaborative robots alongside human workers. First, there must be measures to
ensure the safety of human coworkers; second, the coworkers need to understand
what the robot is doing. This paper addresses both challenges by introducing a
safety and transparency framework for general-purpose meat processing robots.
For safety, we implement a hand-detection system that continuously monitors
nearby humans. This system can halt the robot in situations where the human
comes into close proximity of the operating robot. We also develop an
instrumented knife equipped with a force sensor that can differentiate contact
between objects such as meat, bone, or fixtures. For transparency, we introduce
a method that detects the robot's uncertainty about its performance and uses an
LED interface to communicate that uncertainty to the human. Additionally, we
design a graphical interface that displays the robot's plans and allows the
human to provide feedback on the planned cut. Overall, our framework can ensure
safe operation while keeping human workers in-the-loop about the robot's
actions which we validate through a user study.
