It represents a significant advancement\nin addressing the challenges associated with manual sewing processes.\nTraditional methods for creating pleats are labour-intensive, prone to\ninconsistencies, and require high levels of skill, making automation a critical\nneed in the apparel industry. This research explores the technical feasibility\nand operational benefits of integrating advanced technologies into garment\nproduction, focusing on the creation of an automated machine capable of precise\nfolding and sewing operations and eliminating the marking operation.\n  The proposed machine incorporates key features such as a precision folding\nmechanism integrated into the automated sewing unit with real-time monitoring\ncapabilities. The results demonstrate remarkable improvements: the standard\nlabour time has been reduced by 93%, dropping from 117 seconds per piece to\njust 8 seconds with the automated system. Similarly, machinery time improved by\n73%, and the total output rate increased by 72%. These enhancements translate\ninto a cycle time reduction from 117 seconds per piece to an impressive 33\nseconds, enabling manufacturers to meet customer demand more swiftly. By\neliminating manual marking processes, the machine not only reduces labour costs\nbut also minimizes waste through consistent pleat formation.

In this paper we find that learning the functional relationships while\naccounting for the uncertainty about the structural information leads to more\nrobust dynamics models which improves downstream planning, while using\nsignificantly lower computational resources.

We show\nthat our tactile informed diffusion policies outperform baselines in both\nreduced bruising and pick-and-place success rate across three fruits:\nstrawberries, tomatoes, and blackberries. In addition, we introduce FruitSplat,\na novel technique to represent and quantify visual damage in high-resolution 3D\nrepresentation via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Existing metrics for measuring\ndamage lack quantitative rigor or require expensive equipment. With FruitSplat,\nwe distill a 2D strawberry mask as well as a 2D bruise segmentation mask into\nthe 3DGS representation. Furthermore, this representation is modular and\ngeneral, compatible with any relevant 2D model. Overall, we demonstrate a 92%\ngrasping policy success rate, up to a 20% reduction in visual bruising, and up\nto an 31% improvement in grasp success rate on challenging fruit compared to\nour baselines across our three tested fruits. We rigorously evaluate this\nresult with over 630 trials.

Integrated into the ROS2 ecosystem, we\nvalidate its adaptability and efficiency across both 2D and 3D environments\n(simulated and real world), demonstrating competitive performance with\ntraditional and state of the art exploration approaches while offering a\nbiologically inspired navigation approach.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08AIF\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u9884\u5148\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u5730\u56fe\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u89c4\u5212\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u57282D\u548c3D\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u53d7\u52a8\u7269\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u548c\u66f4\u65b0\u5185\u90e8\u8ba4\u77e5\u5730\u56fe\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\uff08AIF\uff09\uff0c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6784\u5efa\u62d3\u6251\u5730\u56fe\u3001\u63a8\u65ad\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5e76\u89c4\u5212\u52a8\u4f5c\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u9884\u671f\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728ROS2\u751f\u6001\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u57282D\u548c3D\u73af\u5883\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u53ca\u524d\u6cbf\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u751f\u7269\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5bfc\u822a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u4e3b\u52a8\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

While some\nmethods use estimated depth to build collision maps, we found that depth\nestimates from vision foundation models are too noisy for zero-shot navigation\nin cluttered environments.\n  We propose an alternative approach: instead of using noisy estimated depth\nfor direct collision-checking, we use it as a rich context input to a learned\ncollision model. This model predicts the distribution of minimum obstacle\nclearance that the robot can expect for a given control sequence. At inference,\nthese predictions inform a risk-aware MPC planner that minimizes estimated\ncollision risk. Our joint learning pipeline co-trains the collision model and\nrisk metric using both safe and unsafe trajectories.

Project website: https://zl-tian.github.io/MoRoCo/", "summary": "Fleets of autonomous robots are increasingly deployed alongside multiple\nhuman operators to explore unknown environments, identify salient features, and\nperform complex tasks in scenarios such as subterranean exploration,\nreconnaissance, and search-and-rescue missions. In these contexts,\ncommunication is often severely limited to short-range exchanges via ad-hoc\nnetworks, posing challenges to coordination. While recent studies have\naddressed multi-robot exploration under communication constraints, they largely\noverlook the essential role of human operators and their real-time interaction\nwith robotic teams. Operators may demand timely updates on the exploration\nprogress and robot status, reprioritize or cancel tasks dynamically, or request\nlive video feeds and control access. Conversely, robots may seek human\nconfirmation for anomalous events or require help recovering from motion or\nplanning failures. To enable such bilateral, context-aware interactions under\nrestricted communication, this work proposes MoRoCo, a unified framework for\nonline coordination and exploration in multi-operator, multi-robot systems.\nMoRoCo enables the team to adaptively switch among three coordination modes:\nspread mode for parallelized exploration with intermittent data sharing,\nmigrate mode for coordinated relocation, and chain mode for maintaining\nhigh-bandwidth connectivity through multi-hop links. These transitions are\nmanaged through distributed algorithms via only local communication. Extensive\nlarge-scale human-in-the-loop simulations and hardware experiments validate the\nnecessity of incorporating human robot interactions and demonstrate that MoRoCo\nenables efficient, reliable coordination under limited communication, marking a\nsignificant step toward robust human-in-the-loop multi-robot autonomy in\nchallenging environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "MoRoCo\u6846\u67b6\u652f\u6301\u591a\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4e0e\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u6709\u9650\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0b\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u4e0e\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u5f0f\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u5ffd\u89c6\u4eba\u7c7b\u64cd\u4f5c\u5458\u4e0e\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u53cc\u5411\u6c9f\u901a\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMoRoCo\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u79cd\u534f\u8c03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff08spread\u3001migrate\u3001chain\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ba1\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\u5207\u6362\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1MoRoCo\u5728\u6709\u9650\u901a\u4fe1\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u590d\u6742\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "conclusion": "MoRoCo\u4e3a\u6311\u6218\u6027\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u4eba\u673a\u534f\u540c\u591a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, existing single-agent end-to-end pipelines are often\nconstrained by occlusion and limited perception range, resulting in hazardous\ndriving. Furthermore, their black-box nature prevents the interpretability of\nthe driving behavior, leading to an untrustworthiness system. To address these\nlimitations, we introduce Risk Map as Middleware (RiskMM) and propose an\ninterpretable cooperative end-to-end driving framework. The risk map learns\ndirectly from the driving data and provides an interpretable spatiotemporal\nrepresentation of the scenario from the upstream perception and the\ninteractions between the ego vehicle and the surrounding environment for\ndownstream planning. RiskMM first constructs a multi-agent spatiotemporal\nrepresentation with unified Transformer-based architecture, then derives\nrisk-aware representations by modeling interactions among surrounding\nenvironments with attention. These representations are subsequently fed into a\nlearning-based Model Predictive Control (MPC) module. The MPC planner\ninherently accommodates physical constraints and different vehicle types and\ncan provide interpretation by aligning learned parameters with explicit MPC\nelements. Evaluations conducted on the real-world V2XPnP-Seq dataset confirm\nthat RiskMM achieves superior and robust performance in risk-aware trajectory\nplanning, significantly enhancing the interpretability of the cooperative\nend-to-end driving framework.

The only link between the robot and the crane is\nthe interaction force produced during the guiding of the payload. Two\nadmittance transfer functions are considered to accomplish harmless and smooth\ncontact with the payload. The first is used in a position-based admittance\ncontrol integrated with the robot. The second one adds compliance to the crane\nby processing the interaction force through the admittance transfer function to\ngenerate a crane's velocity command that makes the crane follow the payload.\nThen the robot's end-effector and the crane move collaboratively to guide the\npayload to the desired location.

In natural human-human encounters, touch is seldom experienced\nin isolation; rather, it is inherently multisensory. Individuals not only\nperceive the physical sensation of touch but also register the accompanying\nauditory cues generated through contact. The integration of haptic and auditory\ninformation forms a rich and nuanced channel for emotional expression. While\nextensive research has examined how robots convey emotions through facial\nexpressions and speech, their capacity to communicate social gestures and\nemotions via touch remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we\ndeveloped a multimodal interaction system incorporating a 5*5 grid of 25\nvibration motors synchronized with audio playback, enabling robots to deliver\ncombined haptic-audio stimuli. In an experiment involving 32 Chinese\nparticipants, ten emotions and six social gestures were presented through\nvibration, sound, or their combination. Participants rated each stimulus on\narousal and valence scales. The results revealed that (1) the combined\nhaptic-audio modality significantly enhanced decoding accuracy compared to\nsingle modalities; (2) each individual channel-vibration or sound-effectively\nsupported certain emotions recognition, with distinct advantages depending on\nthe emotional expression; and (3) gestures alone were generally insufficient\nfor conveying clearly distinguishable emotions.

Three fundamental limitations hinder progress: First,\nalthough large language models have improved spatial reasoning and task\nplanning through semantic priors, existing implementations remain confined to\ntabletop scenarios, failing to address the constrained perception and limited\nactuation ranges of mobile platforms. Second, current manipulation strategies\nexhibit insufficient generalization when confronted with the diverse object\nconfigurations encountered in open-world environments. Third, while crucial for\npractical deployment, the dual requirement of maintaining high platform\nmaneuverability alongside precise end-effector control in unstructured settings\nremains understudied.\n  In this work, we present ODYSSEY, a unified mobile manipulation framework for\nagile quadruped robots equipped with manipulators, which seamlessly integrates\nhigh-level task planning with low-level whole-body control. To address the\nchallenge of egocentric perception in language-conditioned tasks, we introduce\na hierarchical planner powered by a vision-language model, enabling\nlong-horizon instruction decomposition and precise action execution. At the\ncontrol level, our novel whole-body policy achieves robust coordination across\nchallenging terrains. We further present the first benchmark for long-horizon\nmobile manipulation, evaluating diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios. Through\nsuccessful sim-to-real transfer, we demonstrate the system's generalization and\nrobustness in real-world deployments, underscoring the practicality of legged\nmanipulators in unstructured environments.

We address these gaps with BeyondMimic, the first real-world\nframework to learn from human motions for versatile and naturalistic humanoid\ncontrol via guided diffusion. Our framework provides a motion tracking pipeline\ncapable of challenging skills such as jumping spins, sprinting, and cartwheels\nwith state-of-the-art motion quality. Moving beyond mimicking existing motions\nand synthesize novel ones, we further introduce a unified diffusion policy that\nenables zero-shot task-specific control at test time using simple cost\nfunctions. Deployed on hardware, BeyondMimic performs diverse tasks at test\ntime, including waypoint navigation, joystick teleoperation, and obstacle\navoidance, bridging sim-to-real motion tracking and flexible synthesis of human\nmotion primitives for whole-body control. https://beyondmimic.github.io/.", "AI": {"tldr": "BeyondMimic\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u7c7b\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ece\u4eba\u7c7b\u52a8\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u6280\u80fd\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u901a\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBeyondMimic\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ba1\u9053\u548c\u6269\u6563\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u786c\u4ef6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5982\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u9065\u64cd\u4f5c\u548c\u907f\u969c\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u7075\u6d3b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5408\u6210\u3002", "conclusion": "BeyondMimic\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8fd0\u52a8\u8ddf\u8e2a\u548c\u52a8\u4f5c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7c7b\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
