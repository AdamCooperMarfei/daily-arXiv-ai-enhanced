Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain\nDamage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the\nrecent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local\nHessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite\ntheir success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal\non closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.\nWe present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of\nsecond-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves\nunder a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer\nmultilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.\nPruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\\delta W_k$,\nproducing the perturbed parameter vector $\\widehat{\\Theta}=\\Theta+\\delta\\Theta$\nand the pruned policy $\\pi(\\cdot;\\widehat{\\Theta})$. For every input state\n$s\\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $\n\\|\\pi(s;\\Theta)-\\pi(s;\\widehat{\\Theta})\\|_2 \\le C_k(s)\\,\\|\\delta W_k\\|_2, $\nwhere the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,\nand can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived\nbounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning\nmagnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking\nsecond-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our\nwork narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the\nrobustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4e8c\u9636\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982OBD\u3001OBS\u548cSparseGPT\uff09\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u4e0a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5e76\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u540e\u63a7\u5236\u8bef\u5dee\u7684\u4e0a\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u7b56\u7565\u5728\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63a7\u5236\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5e9e\u5927\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u91cf\u4e0e\u5d4c\u5165\u5f0f\u5fae\u63a7\u5236\u5668\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u8981\u6c42\u51b2\u7a81\u3002\u4e8c\u9636\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u95ed\u73af\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u526a\u679d\u540e\u7684\u6743\u91cd\u6270\u52a8\u5bf9\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u524d\u540e\u7b56\u7565\u8f93\u51fa\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u672a\u526a\u679d\u8c31\u8303\u6570\u548c\u504f\u7f6e\u7684\u5e38\u6570C_k(s)\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u526a\u679d\u5e45\u5ea6\u7684\u6700\u5927\u5141\u8bb8\u503c\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u63a7\u5236\u8bef\u5dee\u4e0d\u8d85\u8fc7\u9884\u8bbe\u9608\u503c\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6027\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5de5\u5177\u4e0e\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a7\u5236\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

By continuously refining predictive models\nthrough online sensor feedback, DK-RRT effectively navigates the manipulator\nthrough evolving obstacle fields. Simulation studies demonstrate DK-RRT's\nsuperior performance in terms of adaptability, robustness, and computational\nefficiency compared to traditional RRT and conventional Koopman-based planning,\nhighlighting its potential for autonomous space manipulation tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "DK-RRT\u7ed3\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u548cKoopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u8f68\u9053\u788e\u7247\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f68\u8ff9\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u6574\u5408\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u3001Koopman\u7b97\u5b50\u7406\u8bba\u548cRRT\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u795e\u7ecf\u7f51\u7edc\u4f18\u5316\u788e\u7247\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u9884\u6d4b\u548c\u89c4\u5212\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cDK-RRT\u5728\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DK-RRT\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u7a7a\u95f4\u64cd\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Current approaches, however, suffer from\nspatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and\nphysical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating\nor overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we\npropose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop\nself-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow\nsystem harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation\n(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a\nfast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set\nthat are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,\nwe further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for\ngenerating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast\nCollaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after\nthorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its\nself-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively\ncorrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and\nsemantic consistency.

Recent\nadvancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective\nsolid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its\ndome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable\nperformance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,\nsuch as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars\nsignificantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across\nplatforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state\nand high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently\nexamined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.\n  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from\nmultiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped\nMid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.\nNotably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively\nincludes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state\nand spinning lidars.

This paper introduces a novel\nvisibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated\nas a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions\nare intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a\nunified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on\nexplicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances\nexploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance\nwould be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against\ndeterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a\ncluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results\ndemonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision\nwith unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance.

Specifically, we\nfirst pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,\nwhich then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values\nusing extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived\nfrom pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from\nthe pre-trained policy for better exploration.

However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in\nshort-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence\nof image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided\ntrajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon\nmanipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art\nvision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,\nmanageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based\ntrajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial\nconditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and\nsubstantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned\nDiffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration\ndata and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation\nexperimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms\nclassical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success\nrate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in\nperformance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or\naltered environments.

This work represents a significant\nstep toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating\ncomplex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faNavigScene\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4e09\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f25\u8865\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u5c40\u90e8\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u5bfc\u822a\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7f3a\u4e4f\u4eba\u7c7b\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2d\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u5bfc\u822a\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bfc\u822a\u5f15\u5bfc\u63a8\u7406\uff1b2. \u5bfc\u822a\u5f15\u5bfc\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\uff1b3. \u5bfc\u822a\u5f15\u5bfc\u89c6\u89c9-\u8bed\u8a00-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u9884\u6d4b\u3001\u89c4\u5212\u53ca\u95ee\u7b54\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel\nstructured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:\ndynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are\nsystematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space\nbaselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our\nframework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that\nprocesses both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed\ndynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on\ncontext and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating\ninvalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse\ndriving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves\ntraining stability and policy performance.
