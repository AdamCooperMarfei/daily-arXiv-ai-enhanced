Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

### [2] [Observer Design for Optical Flow-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry with Almost-Global Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21163)
*Tarek Bouazza,Soulaimane Berkane,Minh-Duc Hua,Tarek Hamel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合光流和IMU测量的级联观测器架构，用于连续单目视觉惯性里程计(VIO)，通过融合光流速度方向信息和IMU数据来同时估计机体速度矢量和重力方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目视觉惯性里程计中连续姿态和速度估计的问题，通过融合光学和惯性传感器数据来提高估计精度和稳定性。

Method: 使用全局指数稳定的Riccati观测器融合光流速度方向与陀螺仪、加速度计数据；在SO(3)上设计互补观测器进行姿态估计；开发梯度下降算法从稀疏光流数据中提取速度方向。

Result: 构建了几乎全局渐近稳定的级联观测器架构，仿真验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的级联观测器架构能够有效实现单目视觉惯性里程计，融合光学和惯性传感器数据提供稳定的速度和姿态估计。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

*Usman A. Khan,Mouhacine Benosman,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Joseph W. Durham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于最优运输理论和模型预测控制的多机器人路径规划与调度方法，解决路径重叠和死锁问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人在共享空间中导航时，先映射机器人到目标再规划路径的方法容易导致路径重叠和死锁，需要一种能够同时保证最优路径和非重叠轨迹的解决方案

Method: 将空间分割为K个单元格，构建K×K转移成本结构，利用最优运输理论计算机器人到目标的最优且非重叠单元格转移，并集成重新规划和模型预测控制来处理异常情况

Result: 算法在最坏情况下需要O(K³logK)计算量，在良好问题中需要O(K²logK)计算量，能够生成可直接部署的最优非重叠轨迹

Conclusion: 该方法通过最优运输理论有效解决了多机器人路径规划中的路径重叠和死锁问题，具有较高的计算效率和实用性

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

*Fatima Mumtaza Tourk,Bishoy Galoaa,Sanat Shajan,Aaron J. Young,Michael Everett,Max K. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知控制框架，使踝关节外骨骼能够通过自动脱离不熟悉动作来安全运行于多样化场景


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有下肢外骨骼控制器局限于离散预定义动作，限制了其在真实世界环境中的实用性

Method: 使用不确定性估计器对动作进行分类（类似训练集动作或不同动作），评估了三种架构（模型集成、自编码器、生成对抗网络）

Result: 在线测试显示不确定性估计器能够在用户在内分布和外分布任务间切换时准确开启和关闭辅助功能（F1分数：89.2）

Conclusion: 该框架为外骨骼在非结构化日常环境中安全自主支持人类运动提供了路径

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test
demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and
off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely
and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

### [5] [Remarks on stochastic cloning and delayed-state filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21260)
*Tara Mina,Lindsey Marinello,John Christian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文重新审视延迟状态卡尔曼滤波方法，证明其与随机克隆方法在状态和协方差更新方面完全等效，但计算效率更高且内存需求更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人学和导航中依赖先前状态的测量问题（如里程计），传统随机克隆方法需要状态向量扩展来处理相关性，但存在计算和内存开销。

Method: 采用广义卡尔曼滤波公式推导延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器，无需状态扩展即可处理相关延迟状态测量。

Result: 证明延迟状态卡尔曼滤波与随机克隆方法在数学上完全等效，但计算复杂度更低，内存需求更少，特别对高维状态优势明显。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波变体能够有效处理相关延迟状态测量，延迟状态卡尔曼滤波提供了一种更高效的替代方案，纠正了该领域的常见误解。

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操控中的组合动作空间爆炸、不安全运动规划和系统组装策略学习的关键挑战

Method: 集成法律动作掩码DQN与层次架构，将Q函数估计分解为方位和位置组件，采用机器人友好奖励函数和三个集训集的课程学习

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了约束感知强化学习与奇异点安全运动规划的系统集成，为自主组装任务提供了高效解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly
learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of
constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with
manipulation constraints. Curriculum learning across three progressive
difficulty levels (2-piece, 3-piece, 7-piece) achieves remarkable training
efficiency: 100\% success rate for Level 1 within 500 episodes, 92.9\% for
Level 2, and 39.9\% for Level 3 over 105,300 total training episodes.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于拟阵理论的贪心算法，用于异构传感器（机器人）的多目标跟踪分配，保证多项式时间复杂度和常数因子近似比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决具有不同感知能力的异构机器人（充足感知和有限感知机器人）在多目标跟踪中的优化分配问题，以最小化目标状态估计的不确定性

Method: 利用拟阵理论设计贪心分配算法，动态将机器人分配给目标以最大化跟踪质量。算法根据机器人感知能力分类处理

Result: 算法保证任意跟踪质量函数的1/3近似比和子模函数的1/2近似比，仿真显示能准确长时间跟踪目标，性能接近最优分配

Conclusion: 所提算法在多项式时间内提供理论保证的近似性能，具有鲁棒性和实际应用价值，适用于异构传感器多目标跟踪场景

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

TL;DR: 通过分布式协同规划框架，给合作车辆协调提供安全保障和实时性能，减少碰撞率40.79%并提升计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态不确定环境下车辆协同调度中安全保障与实时性能的基本挑战

Method: 三项核心创新：1)直接控制轨迹分布的稳健合作规划问题 2)并行ADMM分布式轨迹协商算法 3)交互式注意力机制简化计算

Result: 在各种场景下碰撞率降低40.79%，计算需求减少14.1%，实际实验验证了复杂环境下的稳健协调能力

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了车辆协同中的安全性与实时性问题，具有强大的可扩展性和实际应用价值

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments
with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex
environments. The experiment demo could be found at

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法的新题自动驾驶车运动规划方法，通过Sobol序列采样和分析解冲突避免，在高保真模拟中显著提升了障碍避免性能和车辆稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 使自动驾驶车更有效地避免障碍物，提高运动规划的最优性和车辆稳定性，应对高低摩擦力路面和移动障碍物的挑战。

Method: 采用多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法，使用Sobol序列在优先输入周围采样，结合分析解冲突避免策略，使用非线性单轨车辆模型和Fiala轮胎模型进行预测，并维护轮胎力在摩擦圆内的约束条件。

Result: 在高保真模拟环境中，该算法成功避免障碍物，在双车道变换操作中保持车辆稳定，在高低摩擦力路面和有移动障碍物的遮挡场景下都表现优异，超过了标准模型预测路径积分控制方法。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多模态控制算法通过探索多样化轨迹和维护车辆稳定性，有效提升了自动驾驶车的障碍避免能力和安全性能，为复杂驾驶场景提供了更加可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

*Anuj Pasricha,Joewie Koh,Jay Vakil,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于去噪扩散模型的新型轨迹生成方法，能够充分利用机器人在工作空间不同区域的实际负载能力，突破传统保守的额定负载限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人额定负载基于最坏情况配置，导致整个工作空间采用统一的保守负载约束，严重低估了机器人的实际能力。分析表明机器人在大部分工作区域可以安全处理远超额定容量的负载。

Method: 使用去噪扩散模型进行轨迹生成，将负载约束明确纳入规划过程。与传统采样方法、优化方法或动力学规划器不同，该方法能在恒定时间内生成动态可行的关节空间轨迹，无需后处理即可在物理硬件上直接执行。

Result: 在7自由度Franka Emika Panda机器人上的实验验证表明，即使负载超过额定容量的3倍，仍有高达67.6%的工作空间保持可达。

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了机器人的操作范围，突显了在运动规划算法中更细致考虑负载动力学的重要性，实现了对机器人固有能力的更好利用。

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboInspector是一个分析LLM在机器人操作中策略代码生成不可靠性的框架，通过任务复杂性和指令粒度两个维度识别不可靠行为，并提出基于失败反馈的优化方法，将可靠性提升35%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在代码生成和机器人控制方面表现出色，但由于现实任务的多样性和用户指令的复杂性，策略代码生成的可靠性仍然是一个重大挑战。不同用户对同一任务可能给出不同的指令，导致策略代码生成不可靠。

Method: 设计RoboInspector管道，从操作任务复杂性和指令粒度两个角度分析和表征策略代码的不可靠性。在两大主流框架中进行168种任务-指令-LLM组合的全面实验，识别四种主要不可靠行为。

Result: 识别出导致操作失败的四种主要不可靠行为，并详细表征了这些行为及其根本原因。提出基于失败策略代码反馈的优化方法，在仿真和真实环境中将策略代码生成的可靠性提升高达35%。

Conclusion: RoboInspector有效揭示了LLM在机器人操作中策略代码生成的不可靠性问题，提供了实用的开发见解，并通过反馈驱动的优化方法显著提高了系统可靠性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出在机器人社交导航中通过几何分析和有效沟通来解决人机交互中的意图理解问题，特别是在正面交叉场景中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的社交导航策略虽然使用了人类预测模型，但当人类行为出乎意料时仍面临困难，因为机器人无法理解人类意图和合作性，而人类也不清楚机器人的规划。

Method: 通过几何分析上下文和人类合作性，在适当时间进行有效沟通。提出了评估方法来区分合作与非合作人类，并展示如何使用几何推理生成合适的语言回应或机器人动作。

Result: 提出了基于几何分析的沟通框架和评估指标，能够识别人类合作性并生成相应的沟通策略。

Conclusion: 通过几何推理和适时沟通可以显著改善社交机器人导航中的人机交互问题，特别是在意图不明确的情况下。

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six
domains that involve four robotic arms, Stacking, Kitchen, Assembly, and Towers

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

Abstract: We present a multi-modal dataset collected in a soybean crop field,
comprising over two hours of recorded data from sensors such as stereo infrared
camera, color camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GNSS (Single
Point Positioning, Real-Time Kinematic and Post-Processed Kinematic), and wheel
odometry. This dataset captures key challenges inherent to robotics in
agricultural environments, including variations in natural lighting, motion
blur, rough terrain, and long, perceptually aliased sequences. By addressing
these complexities, the dataset aims to support the development and
benchmarking of advanced algorithms for localization, mapping, perception, and
navigation in agricultural robotics. The platform and data collection system is
designed to meet the key requirements for evaluating multi-modal SLAM systems,
including hardware synchronization of sensors, 6-DOF ground truth and loops on
long trajectories.
  We run multimodal state-of-the art SLAM methods on the dataset, showcasing
the existing limitations in their application on agricultural settings. The

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model
learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and
thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the
modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and
encourage further exploration.
