### [1] [On the causality between affective impact and coordinated human-robot reactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04834)
*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨机器人通过主动分享事件反应如何影响人类对其情感影响的感知，发现共享事件反应和接近人类的反应时间能显著提升感知效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改善机器人在社交环境中的功能，探究其情感表达对人类感知的影响。

Method: 设计了两个实验：一个隔离机器人反应元素，另一个测试不同反应延迟时间对物理互动的影响。

Result: 共享事件反应显著改变人类对机器人情感影响的感知；物理互动中，接近人类的反应时间（约200ms）效果最佳。

Conclusion: 200ms的反应延迟对小型非人形机器人最有效；若目标是让人类感觉对机器人影响最大，100ms的反应时间更佳。

Abstract: In an effort to improve how robots function in social contexts, this paper
investigates if a robot that actively shares a reaction to an event with a
human alters how the human perceives the robot's affective impact. To verify
this, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the
reaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the
effects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical
encounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups
(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting
with the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using
increasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.
The results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived
affective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human
observer rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared
physical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most
appropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around
200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized
non-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time
around 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers
feel they made the biggest impact on the robot.

### [2] [INTENTION: Inferring Tendencies of Humanoid Robot Motion Through Interactive Intuition and Grounded VLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04931)
*Jin Wang,Weijie Wang,Boyuan Deng,Heng Zhang,Rui Dai,Nikos Tsagarakis*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出INTENTION框架，通过结合视觉语言模型和交互驱动记忆，赋予机器人学习交互直觉和自主操作能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人控制依赖精确物理模型和预定义动作序列，在复杂场景中表现不佳，而人类能通过直觉适应环境，因此需要开发类似人类的交互直觉能力。

Method: 提出INTENTION框架，包含Memory Graph记录任务交互场景，以及Intuitive Perceptor从视觉场景中提取物理关系和功能属性。

Result: 机器人能在新场景中推断适当交互行为，无需重复指令。

Conclusion: INTENTION框架显著提升了机器人在多样化场景中的自主操作能力。

Abstract: Traditional control and planning for robotic manipulation heavily rely on
precise physical models and predefined action sequences. While effective in
structured environments, such approaches often fail in real-world scenarios due
to modeling inaccuracies and struggle to generalize to novel tasks. In
contrast, humans intuitively interact with their surroundings, demonstrating
remarkable adaptability, making efficient decisions through implicit physical
understanding. In this work, we propose INTENTION, a novel framework enabling
robots with learned interactive intuition and autonomous manipulation in
diverse scenarios, by integrating Vision-Language Models (VLMs) based scene
reasoning with interaction-driven memory. We introduce Memory Graph to record
scenes from previous task interactions which embodies human-like understanding
and decision-making about different tasks in real world. Meanwhile, we design
an Intuitive Perceptor that extracts physical relations and affordances from
visual scenes. Together, these components empower robots to infer appropriate
interaction behaviors in new scenes without relying on repetitive instructions.

### [3] [Optimal Planning for Multi-Robot Simultaneous Area and Line Coverage Using Hierarchical Cyclic Merging Regulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04981)
*Tianyuan Zheng,Jingang Yi,Kaiyan Yu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于分层循环合并调节（HCMR）的算法，用于解决多机器人同时覆盖线性特征和区域的路径规划问题，显著提升了路径长度和任务时间效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多机器人在已知环境中同时覆盖线性特征和区域时的路径规划问题，目标是实现高效、无碰撞的路径。

Method: 采用分层循环合并调节（HCMR）算法，结合Morse理论分析流形附着过程，通过循环合并搜索和边序列反向传播生成最优路径。

Result: HCMR算法在路径长度上至少提升10.0%，任务时间平均减少16.9%，并确保无冲突操作。

Conclusion: HCMR算法在固定扫描方向下具有最优性，显著优于现有规划方法。

Abstract: The double coverage problem focuses on determining efficient, collision-free
routes for multiple robots to simultaneously cover linear features (e.g.,
surface cracks or road routes) and survey areas (e.g., parking lots or local
regions) in known environments. In these problems, each robot carries two
functional roles: service (linear feature footprint coverage) and exploration
(complete area coverage). Service has a smaller operational footprint but
incurs higher costs (e.g., time) compared to exploration. We present optimal
planning algorithms for the double coverage problems using hierarchical cyclic
merging regulation (HCMR). To reduce the complexity for optimal planning
solutions, we analyze the manifold attachment process during graph traversal
from a Morse theory perspective. We show that solutions satisfying minimum path
length and collision-free constraints must belong to a Morse-bounded
collection. To identify this collection, we introduce the HCMR algorithm. In
HCMR, cyclic merging search regulates traversal behavior, while edge sequence
back propagation converts these regulations into graph edge traversal
sequences. Incorporating balanced partitioning, the optimal sequence is
selected to generate routes for each robot. We prove the optimality of the HCMR
algorithm under a fixed sweep direction. The multi-robot simulation results
demonstrate that the HCMR algorithm significantly improves planned path length
by at least 10.0%, reduces task time by at least 16.9% in average, and ensures
conflict-free operation compared to other state-of-the-art planning methods.

### [4] [Hierarchical Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient for Autonomous Maze Navigation of Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04994)
*Wenjie Hu,Ye Zhou,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的层次化DDPG（HDDPG）算法，通过分层策略和改进的探索与奖励机制，显著提升了迷宫导航任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准DDPG算法在迷宫导航中表现不佳，主要由于稀疏奖励、低效探索和长时规划困难。

Method: HDDPG采用分层策略，高层生成子目标，低层执行动作，并结合离策略校正、自适应噪声和优化奖励函数。

Result: 实验表明，HDDPG在成功率和平均奖励上分别至少提升了56.59%和519.03。

Conclusion: HDDPG有效解决了标准DDPG的局限性，显著提升了迷宫导航任务的性能。

Abstract: Maze navigation is a fundamental challenge in robotics, requiring agents to
traverse complex environments efficiently. While the Deep Deterministic Policy
Gradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze
navigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and
long-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and
average rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To
address these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG
(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The
high-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate
subgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The
low-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates
primitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal
assigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with
off-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical
experiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to
improve exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is
employed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including
gradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve
robustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical
simulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and
Gazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze
navigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard
DDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and
boosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline
algorithms.

### [5] [MAG-Nav: Language-Driven Object Navigation Leveraging Memory-Reserved Active Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05021)
*Weifan Zhang,Tingguang Li,Yuzhen Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉语言模型（VLMs）的导航框架，通过主动视角调整和历史记忆回溯机制，显著提升了复杂未知环境中的视觉语言定位能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决智能机器人在未知环境中仅依赖自然语言描述进行视觉导航的问题。

Method: 结合视角主动定位和历史记忆回溯机制，优化感知并利用记忆解决模糊性。

Result: 在Habitat-Matterport 3D（HM3D）上表现优于现有方法，并在四足机器人上验证了实用性。

Conclusion: 该框架在零样本条件下实现了对多样化语言描述的强泛化能力，无需标注数据或微调。

Abstract: Visual navigation in unknown environments based solely on natural language
descriptions is a key capability for intelligent robots. In this work, we
propose a navigation framework built upon off-the-shelf Visual Language Models
(VLMs), enhanced with two human-inspired mechanisms: perspective-based active
grounding, which dynamically adjusts the robot's viewpoint for improved visual
inspection, and historical memory backtracking, which enables the system to
retain and re-evaluate uncertain observations over time. Unlike existing
approaches that passively rely on incidental visual inputs, our method actively
optimizes perception and leverages memory to resolve ambiguity, significantly
improving vision-language grounding in complex, unseen environments. Our
framework operates in a zero-shot manner, achieving strong generalization to
diverse and open-ended language descriptions without requiring labeled data or
model fine-tuning. Experimental results on Habitat-Matterport 3D (HM3D) show
that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in language-driven
object navigation. We further demonstrate its practicality through real-world
deployment on a quadruped robot, achieving robust and effective navigation
performance.

### [6] [Benchmarking Shortcutting Techniques for Multi-Robot-Arm Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05027)
*Philip Huang,Yorai Shaoul,Jiaoyang Li*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文研究了多机器人臂运动规划中的捷径优化方法，比较了现有方法并提出两种组合策略以实现最佳性能与运行时间的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人臂运动规划的高维度和潜在碰撞问题导致传统方法生成的轨迹在平滑性和执行时间上表现不佳，现有捷径优化方法缺乏详细描述和性能分析。

Method: 通过定量比较现有捷径优化方法，分析其优缺点，并提出两种组合策略。

Result: 在多种模拟场景中验证了不同捷径方法的性能，并展示了组合策略的优势。

Conclusion: 提出的组合策略在多机器人臂运动规划中实现了性能与运行时间的最佳平衡，相关资源已公开。

Abstract: Generating high-quality motion plans for multiple robot arms is challenging
due to the high dimensionality of the system and the potential for inter-arm
collisions. Traditional motion planning methods often produce motions that are
suboptimal in terms of smoothness and execution time for multi-arm systems.
Post-processing via shortcutting is a common approach to improve motion quality
for efficient and smooth execution. However, in multi-arm scenarios, optimizing
one arm's motion must not introduce collisions with other arms. Although
existing multi-arm planning works often use some form of shortcutting
techniques, their exact methodology and impact on performance are often vaguely
described. In this work, we present a comprehensive study quantitatively
comparing existing shortcutting methods for multi-arm trajectories across
diverse simulated scenarios. We carefully analyze the pros and cons of each
shortcutting method and propose two simple strategies for combining these
methods to achieve the best performance-runtime tradeoff. Video, code, and
dataset are available at https://philip-huang.github.io/mr-shortcut/.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 外部碰撞对机器人执行器构成风险，尤其是在抓取圆形物体时，需要一种方法来检测碰撞以保持稳定抓取。

Method: 使用眼在手相机监测手指和抓取物体的运动，并开发了碰撞丰富的抓取策略。

Result: 实验表明系统能即时响应碰撞，并能精确检测碰撞方向和大小。

Conclusion: 该系统能有效提升软夹持器在动态抓取中的稳定性和安全性。

Abstract: External collisions to robot actuators typically pose risks to grasping
circular objects. This work presents a vision-based sensing module capable of
detecting collisions to maintain stable grasping with a soft gripper system.
The system employs an eye-in-palm camera with a broad field of view to
simultaneously monitor the motion of fingers and the grasped object.
Furthermore, we have developed a collision-rich grasping strategy to ensure the
stability and security of the entire dynamic grasping process. A physical soft
gripper was manufactured and affixed to a collaborative robotic arm to evaluate
the performance of the collision detection mechanism. An experiment regarding
testing the response time of the mechanism confirmed the system has the
capability to react to the collision instantaneously. A dodging test was
conducted to demonstrate the gripper can detect the direction and scale of
external collisions precisely.

Motivation: 提升人机交互中机器人动作的可读性，使人类能更安全、准确地理解机器人意图。

Method: 使用NICO人形机器人设计实验，观察参与者对不同线索（注视、指向、指向与注视一致/不一致）下截断手臂动作的预测能力。

Result: 实验支持多模态优越性和视觉主导性假设。

Conclusion: 机器人动作的可读性可通过多模态线索（如注视和指向）提升，视觉线索在预测意图中起关键作用。

Abstract: Human--robot interaction requires robots whose actions are legible, allowing
humans to interpret, predict, and feel safe around them. This study
investigates the legibility of humanoid robot arm movements in a pointing task,
aiming to understand how humans predict robot intentions from truncated
movements and bodily cues. We designed an experiment using the NICO humanoid
robot, where participants observed its arm movements towards targets on a
touchscreen. Robot cues varied across conditions: gaze, pointing, and pointing
with congruent or incongruent gaze. Arm trajectories were stopped at 60\% or
80\% of their full length, and participants predicted the final target. We
tested the multimodal superiority and ocular primacy hypotheses, both of which
were supported by the experiment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索远程机器人操作在老年护理中的潜力，研究距离对用户感知的影响。

Method: 设计问卷和基于ROS/Unity的软件架构，比较远程与本地操作的用户感知。

Result: 远程与本地操作的用户感知无显著差异。

Conclusion: 远程机器人操作可能是传统本地控制的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Robot teleoperation (RTo) has emerged as a viable alternative to local
control, particularly when human intervention is still necessary. This research
aims to study the distance effect on user perception in RTo, exploring the
potential of teleoperated robots for older adult care. We propose an evaluation
of non-expert users' perception of long-distance RTo, examining how their
perception changes before and after interaction, as well as comparing it to
that of locally operated robots. We have designed a specific protocol
consisting of multiple questionnaires, along with a dedicated software
architecture using the Robotics Operating System (ROS) and Unity. The results
revealed no statistically significant differences between the local and remote
robot conditions, suggesting that robots may be a viable alternative to
traditional local control.

### [10] [Chemist Eye: A Visual Language Model-Powered System for Safety Monitoring and Robot Decision-Making in Self-Driving Laboratories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05148)
*Francisco Munguia-Galeano,Zhengxue Zhou,Satheeshkumar Veeramani,Hatem Fakhruldeen,Louis Longley,Rob Clowes,Andrew I. Cooper*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Chemist Eye是一个分布式安全监控系统，用于提升自驱动实验室（SDL）的安全意识，通过视觉语言模型（VLM）检测危险并指导机器人行动。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自驱动实验室中，机器人与自动化设备的引入增加了安全风险，如火灾和PPE不合规问题，需要高效的安全监控系统。

Method: 系统整合RGB、深度和红外摄像头，利用VLM进行决策，实时监控危险并指导机器人避障或发出警告。

Result: 在真实SDL环境中测试，Chemist Eye对安全危害的检测和决策准确率分别达到97%和95%。

Conclusion: Chemist Eye能有效提升SDL的安全性，通过实时监控和智能决策减少潜在风险。

Abstract: The integration of robotics and automation into self-driving laboratories
(SDLs) can introduce additional safety complexities, in addition to those that
already apply to conventional research laboratories. Personal protective
equipment (PPE) is an essential requirement for ensuring the safety and
well-being of workers in laboratories, self-driving or otherwise. Fires are
another important risk factor in chemical laboratories. In SDLs, fires that
occur close to mobile robots, which use flammable lithium batteries, could have
increased severity. Here, we present Chemist Eye, a distributed safety
monitoring system designed to enhance situational awareness in SDLs. The system
integrates multiple stations equipped with RGB, depth, and infrared cameras,
designed to monitor incidents in SDLs. Chemist Eye is also designed to spot
workers who have suffered a potential accident or medical emergency, PPE
compliance and fire hazards. To do this, Chemist Eye uses decision-making
driven by a vision-language model (VLM). Chemist Eye is designed for seamless
integration, enabling real-time communication with robots. Based on the VLM
recommendations, the system attempts to drive mobile robots away from potential
fire locations, exits, or individuals not wearing PPE, and issues audible
warnings where necessary. It also integrates with third-party messaging
platforms to provide instant notifications to lab personnel. We tested Chemist
Eye with real-world data from an SDL equipped with three mobile robots and
found that the spotting of possible safety hazards and decision-making
performances reached 97 % and 95 %, respectively.

### [11] [FCBV-Net: Category-Level Robotic Garment Smoothing via Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05153)
*Mohammed Daba,Jing Qiu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FCBV-Net通过预训练的几何特征增强类别级策略泛化能力，显著提升机器人服装操作的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人服装操作中因高维度、复杂动态和类别内变化导致的泛化难题。

Method: 提出FCBV-Net，基于3D点云，利用预训练的几何特征预测双手动作价值，下游可训练组件学习任务策略。

Result: 在模拟实验中，FCBV-Net表现出色，泛化效率仅下降11.5%，最终覆盖率达89%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 几何理解与双手动作价值学习的解耦能显著提升类别级泛化能力。

Abstract: Category-level generalization for robotic garment manipulation, such as
bimanual smoothing, remains a significant hurdle due to high dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and intra-category variations. Current approaches often
struggle, either overfitting with concurrently learned visual features for a
specific instance or, despite category-level perceptual generalization, failing
to predict the value of synergistic bimanual actions. We propose the
Feature-Conditioned Bimanual Value Network (FCBV-Net), operating on 3D point
clouds to specifically enhance category-level policy generalization for garment
smoothing. FCBV-Net conditions bimanual action value prediction on pre-trained,
frozen dense geometric features, ensuring robustness to intra-category garment
variations. Trainable downstream components then learn a task-specific policy
using these static features. In simulated GarmentLab experiments with the
CLOTH3D dataset, FCBV-Net demonstrated superior category-level generalization.
It exhibited only an 11.5% efficiency drop (Steps80) on unseen garments
compared to 96.2% for a 2D image-based baseline, and achieved 89% final
coverage, outperforming an 83% coverage from a 3D correspondence-based baseline
that uses identical per-point geometric features but a fixed primitive. These
results highlight that the decoupling of geometric understanding from bimanual
action value learning enables better category-level generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言-动作（VLA）模型因静态视角和共享视觉编码器导致的3D感知不足和任务干扰问题。

Method: 结合主动视角规划和任务特定表征学习，采用高效探索策略和混合专家（MoE）视觉编码器。

Result: 在RLBench任务中表现优于固定视角方法，生成更完整和区分性的视觉表征。

Conclusion: TAVP通过任务感知的视觉表征显著提升了动作预测能力，适用于广泛的机器人操作任务。

Abstract: Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models for multi-task robotic
manipulation commonly rely on static viewpoints and shared visual encoders,
which limit 3D perception and cause task interference, hindering robustness and
generalization. In this work, we propose Task-Aware View Planning (TAVP), a
framework designed to overcome these challenges by integrating active view
planning with task-specific representation learning. TAVP employs an efficient
exploration policy, accelerated by a novel pseudo-environment, to actively
acquire informative views. Furthermore, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
visual encoder to disentangle features across different tasks, boosting both
representation fidelity and task generalization. By learning to see the world
in a task-aware way, TAVP generates more complete and discriminative visual
representations, demonstrating significantly enhanced action prediction across
a wide array of manipulation challenges. Extensive experiments on RLBench tasks
show that our proposed TAVP model achieves superior performance over
state-of-the-art fixed-view approaches. Visual results and code are provided

Motivation: 研究儿童与机器人表演者的互动，以优化人机交互系统。

Method: 通过观察分析18名儿童与机器人NED的互动，评估其设计、行为和互动效果。

Result: 儿童对机器人表现出好奇心，但互动中存在三大挑战。

Conclusion: 需优化HRI系统，考虑观众能力与期望，以提升儿童互动体验。

Abstract: This paper presents an evaluation of 18 children's in-the-wild experiences
with the autonomous robot arm performer NED (Never-Ending Dancer) within the
Thingamabobas installation, showcased across the UK. We detail NED's design,
including costume, behaviour, and human interactions, all integral to the
installation. Our observational analysis revealed three key challenges in
child-robot interactions: 1) Initiating and maintaining engagement, 2) Lack of
robot expressivity and reciprocity, and 3) Unmet expectations. Our findings
show that children are naturally curious, and adept at interacting with a
robotic art performer. However, our observations emphasise the critical need to
optimise human-robot interaction (HRI) systems through careful consideration of
audience's capabilities, perceptions, and expectations, within the performative
arts context, to enable engaging and meaningful experiences, especially for
young audiences.

Conclusion: 结论强调基础模型在机器人领域的快速发展，未来需进一步研究代理架构的通用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Foundation models, including large language models (LLMs) and vision-language
models (VLMs), have recently enabled novel approaches to robot autonomy and
human-robot interfaces. In parallel, vision-language-action models (VLAs) or
large behavior models (BLMs) are increasing the dexterity and capabilities of
robotic systems. This survey paper focuses on those words advancing towards
agentic applications and architectures. This includes initial efforts exploring
GPT-style interfaces to tooling, as well as more complex system where AI agents
are coordinators, planners, perception actors, or generalist interfaces. Such
agentic architectures allow robots to reason over natural language
instructions, invoke APIs, plan task sequences, or assist in operations and
diagnostics. In addition to peer-reviewed research, due to the fast-evolving
nature of the field, we highlight and include community-driven projects, ROS
packages, and industrial frameworks that show emerging trends. We propose a
taxonomy for classifying model integration approaches and present a comparative
analysis of the role that agents play in different solutions in today's
literature.

TL;DR: GhostShell利用大型语言模型（LLMs）实现实时行为编程，通过动态功能调用和调度，显著提升机器人系统的响应速度和行为准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖预定义行为序列或行为树，难以实现实时动态响应，GhostShell旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 采用流式XML函数令牌解析器、动态功能接口映射器和多通道调度器，支持同步和异步功能调用。

Result: 在34个实际任务中，GhostShell的行为正确性达到0.85，响应速度提升66倍，且在多模态任务中表现稳健。

Conclusion: GhostShell为实时机器人行为编程提供了高效、灵活的解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: We present GhostShell, a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models
(LLMs) to enable streaming and concurrent behavioral programming for embodied
systems. In contrast to conventional methods that rely on pre-scheduled action
sequences or behavior trees, GhostShell drives embodied systems to act
on-the-fly by issuing function calls incrementally as tokens are streamed from
the LLM. GhostShell features a streaming XML function token parser, a dynamic
function interface mapper, and a multi-channel scheduler that orchestrates
intra-channel synchronous and inter-channel asynchronous function calls,
thereby coordinating serial-parallel embodied actions across multiple robotic
components as directed by the LLM. We evaluate GhostShell on our robot
prototype COCO through comprehensive grounded experiments across 34 real-world
interaction tasks and multiple LLMs. The results demonstrate that our approach
achieves state-of-the-art Behavioral Correctness Metric of 0.85 with Claude-4
Sonnet and up to 66X faster response times compared to LLM native function
calling APIs. GhostShell also proves effective in long-horizon multimodal
tasks, demonstrating strong robustness and generalization.

the reliance on low-level trajectory imitation, which fails to generalize
across object types, spatial layouts, and manipulator configurations. We
propose Graph-Fused Vision-Language-Action (GF-VLA), a framework that enables
dual-arm robotic systems to perform task-level reasoning and execution directly
from RGB and Depth human demonstrations. GF-VLA first extracts
Shannon-information-based cues to identify hands and objects with the highest
task relevance, then encodes these cues into temporally ordered scene graphs
that capture both hand-object and object-object interactions. These graphs are
fused with a language-conditioned transformer that generates hierarchical
behavior trees and interpretable Cartesian motion commands. To improve
execution efficiency in bimanual settings, we further introduce a cross-hand
selection policy that infers optimal gripper assignment without explicit
geometric reasoning. We evaluate GF-VLA on four structured dual-arm block
assembly tasks involving symbolic shape construction and spatial
generalization. Experimental results show that the information-theoretic scene
representation achieves over 95 percent graph accuracy and 93 percent subtask
segmentation, supporting the LLM planner in generating reliable and
human-readable task policies. When executed by the dual-arm robot, these
policies yield 94 percent grasp success, 89 percent placement accuracy, and 90
percent overall task success across stacking, letter-building, and geometric
reconfiguration scenarios, demonstrating strong generalization and robustness
across diverse spatial and semantic variations.

Method: 框架分为两部分：上下文表示和行为优先级学习，通过聚类物理属性并优化行为优先级。

Result: 在72次交互实验中，机器人能自主学习和泛化行为优先级，适应新物理环境。

Conclusion: Affecta-context框架有效提升了社交机器人在多样化环境中的行为适应能力。

Abstract: This paper presents Affecta-context, a general framework to facilitate
behavior adaptation for social robots. The framework uses information about the
physical context to guide its behaviors in human-robot interactions. It
consists of two parts: one that represents encountered contexts and one that
learns to prioritize between behaviors through human-robot interactions. As
physical contexts are encountered the framework clusters them by their measured
physical properties. In each context, the framework learns to prioritize
between behaviors to optimize the physical attributes of the robot's behavior
in line with its current environment and the preferences of the users it
interacts with. This paper illlustrates the abilities of the Affecta-context
framework by enabling a robot to autonomously learn the prioritization of
discrete behaviors. This was achieved by training across 72 interactions in two
different physical contexts with 6 different human test participants. The paper
demonstrates the trained Affecta-context framework by verifying the robot's
ability to generalize over the input and to match its behaviors to a previously
unvisited physical context.

Motivation: 传统IEKF在联合优化相机姿态和地标时计算负担高，限制了其多传感器融合的适用性。

Result: 该方法在仿真和实际实验中表现出更高的效率和精度。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了GVIO系统的性能，适用于多传感器融合场景。

Abstract: Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) has been a significant technique in
vision-aided sensor fusion. However, it usually suffers from high computational
burden when jointly optimizing camera poses and the landmarks. To improve its
efficiency and applicability for multi-sensor fusion, we present a multi-view
pose-only estimation approach with its application to GNSS-Visual-Inertial
Odometry (GVIO) in this paper. Our main contribution is deriving a visual
measurement model which directly associates landmark representation with
multiple camera poses and observations. Such a pose-only measurement is proven
to be tightly-coupled between landmarks and poses, and maintain a perfect null
space that is independent of estimated poses. Finally, we apply the proposed
approach to a filter based GVIO with a novel feature management strategy. Both
simulation tests and real-world experiments are conducted to demonstrate the
superiority of the proposed method in terms of efficiency and accuracy.

*Morten Roed Frederiksen,Kasper Støy*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 研究探讨了机器人在高强度冲突中如何通过五种情感表达模式化解冲突，发现所有模式均有效，但运动模式表现不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解机器人如何通过情感表达缓解人与机器人之间的高强度冲突，尤其是针对表现不佳的机器人引发的敌意。

Method: 使用定制的情感机器人在模拟冲突场景中测试105名参与者，评估五种情感表达模式的效果。

Result: 所有表达模式均能成功化解冲突，运动模式表现显著不同（p<.05），但参与者对机器人情感影响的感知相似。

Conclusion: 化解高强度冲突可能更依赖机器人的社会情境感知能力，而非特定表达模式。

Abstract: This paper investigates the specific scenario of high-intensity
confrontations between humans and robots, to understand how robots can defuse
the conflict. It focuses on the effectiveness of using five different affective
expression modalities as main drivers for defusing the conflict. The aim is to
discover any strengths or weaknesses in using each modality to mitigate the
hostility that people feel towards a poorly performing robot. The defusing of
the situation is accomplished by making the robot better at acknowledging the
conflict and by letting it express remorse. To facilitate the tests, we used a
custom affective robot in a simulated conflict situation with 105 test
participants. The results show that all tested expression modalities can
successfully be used to defuse the situation and convey an acknowledgment of
the confrontation. The ratings were remarkably similar, but the movement
modality was different (ANON p$<$.05) than the other modalities. The test
participants also had similar affective interpretations on how impacted the
robot was of the confrontation across all expression modalities. This indicates
that defusing a high-intensity interaction may not demand special attention to
the expression abilities of the robot, but rather require attention to the
abilities of being socially aware of the situation and reacting in accordance
with it.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少推理时间，性能与全步去噪的扩散策略相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为预训练扩散模型提供了一种高效推理方案，适用于资源密集型大模型。

Abstract: Diffusion Policies have demonstrated impressive performance in robotic
manipulation tasks. However, their long inference time, resulting from an
extensive iterative denoising process, and the need to execute an action chunk
before the next prediction to maintain consistent actions limit their
applicability to latency-critical tasks or simple tasks with a short cycle
time. While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy
structures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,
which can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we
introduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a
method from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging
solutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent
iterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference
and propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such
as grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces
runtime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy
redesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained
diffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We
also provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful
for estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive
simulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with
comparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step
denoising. Our project page with additional resources is available at:

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上，碰撞率降低50%，闭环性能提升3点。

Conclusion: DistillDrive通过知识蒸馏和多样化实例模仿，显著提升了自动驾驶的决策鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has been recently seen rapid development,
exerting a profound influence on both industry and academia. However, the
existing work places excessive focus on ego-vehicle status as their sole
learning objectives and lacks of planning-oriented understanding, which limits
the robustness of the overall decision-making prcocess. In this work, we
introduce DistillDrive, an end-to-end knowledge distillation-based autonomous
driving model that leverages diversified instance imitation to enhance
multi-mode motion feature learning. Specifically, we employ a planning model
based on structured scene representations as the teacher model, leveraging its
diversified planning instances as multi-objective learning targets for the
end-to-end model. Moreover, we incorporate reinforcement learning to enhance
the optimization of state-to-decision mappings, while utilizing generative
modeling to construct planning-oriented instances, fostering intricate
interactions within the latent space. We validate our model on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets, achieving a 50\% reduction in collision rate and a 3-point
improvement in closed-loop performance compared to the baseline model. Code and
model are publicly available at https://github.com/YuruiAI/DistillDrive

Abstract: Natural organisms use distributed actuation via their musculoskeletal systems
to adapt their gait for traversing diverse terrains or to morph their bodies to
perform varied tasks. A longstanding challenge in the field of robotics is to
mimic this extensive adaptability and range of motion. This has led humans to
develop various soft robotic systems that emulate natural organisms. However,
such systems are generally optimized for a single functionality, lack the
ability to change form or function on demand, or are often tethered to bulky
control systems. To address these challenges, we present our framework for
designing and controlling robots that mimic nature's blueprint by utilizing
distributed actuation. We propose a novel building block that combines
3D-printed bones with liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) muscles as lightweight
actuators and enables the modular assembly of musculoskeletal robots. We
developed LCE rods that contract in response to infrared radiation, thereby
achieving local and untethered control over the distributed network of bones,
which in turn results in global deformation of the robot. Furthermore, to
capitalize on the extensive design space, we develop two computational tools:
one to optimize the robot's skeletal graph, enabling multiple target
deformations, and another to co-optimize the skeletal designs and control gaits
to achieve target locomotion. We validate our system by building several robots
that show complex shape morphing, varying control schemes, and adaptability to
their environment. Our system integrates advances in modular material building,
untethered and distributed control, and computational design to introduce a new
generation of robots that brings us closer to the capabilities of living
organisms.

Abstract: Human manipulation skills represent a pinnacle of their voluntary motor
functions, requiring the coordination of many degrees of freedom and processing
of high-dimensional sensor input to achieve such a high level of dexterity.
Thus, we set out to answer whether the human hand, with its associated
biomechanical properties, sensors, and control mechanisms, is an ideal that we
should strive for in robotics-do we really need anthropomorphic robotic hands?
  This survey can help practitioners to make the trade-off between hand
complexity and potential manipulation skills. We provide an overview of the
human hand, a comparison of commercially available robotic and prosthetic
hands, and a systematic review of hand mechanisms and skills that they are
capable of. This leads to follow-up questions. What is the minimum requirement
for mechanisms and sensors to implement most skills that a robot needs? What is
missing to reach human-level dexterity? Can we improve upon human dexterity?
  Although complex five-fingered hands are often used as the ultimate goal for
robotic manipulators, they are not necessary for all tasks. We found that wrist
flexibility and finger abduction/adduction are important for manipulation
capabilities. On the contrary, increasing the number of fingers, actuators, or
degrees of freedom is often not necessary. Three fingers are a good compromise
between simplicity and dexterity. Non-anthropomorphic hand designs with two
opposing pairs of fingers or human hands with six fingers can further increase
dexterity, suggesting that the human hand may not be the optimum.

Conclusion: MICoBot通过多层级决策和混合主动对话，有效适应多样化人类伙伴，优化协作效果。

Abstract: Effective robotic systems for long-horizon human-robot collaboration must
adapt to a wide range of human partners, whose physical behavior, willingness
to assist, and understanding of the robot's capabilities may change over time.
This demands a tightly coupled communication loop that grants both agents the
flexibility to propose, accept, or decline requests as they coordinate toward
completing the task effectively. We apply a Mixed-Initiative dialog paradigm to
Collaborative human-roBot teaming and propose MICoBot, a system that handles
the common scenario where both agents, using natural language, take initiative
in formulating, accepting, or rejecting proposals on who can best complete
different steps of a task. To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find
successful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes
decisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to
formulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally
allocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities
(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's
estimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the
low-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive
evaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique
human participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to
effectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly
improved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other
agent allocation models. See additional videos and materials at

Abstract: Embodied AI benchmarks have advanced navigation, manipulation, and reasoning,
but most target complex humanoid agents or large-scale simulations that are far
from real-world deployment. In contrast, mobile cleaning robots with dual mode
capabilities, such as sweeping and grasping, are rapidly emerging as realistic
and commercially viable platforms. However, no benchmark currently exists that
systematically evaluates these agents in structured, multi-target cleaning
tasks, revealing a critical gap between academic research and real-world
applications. We introduce CleanUpBench, a reproducible and extensible
benchmark for evaluating embodied agents in realistic indoor cleaning
scenarios. Built on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, CleanUpBench simulates a mobile service
robot equipped with a sweeping mechanism and a six-degree-of-freedom robotic
arm, enabling interaction with heterogeneous objects. The benchmark includes
manually designed environments and one procedurally generated layout to assess
generalization, along with a comprehensive evaluation suite covering task
completion, spatial efficiency, motion quality, and control performance. To
support comparative studies, we provide baseline agents based on heuristic
strategies and map-based planning. CleanUpBench bridges the gap between
low-level skill evaluation and full-scene testing, offering a scalable testbed
for grounded, embodied intelligence in everyday settings.

Abstract: Mobile robots navigating in crowds trained using reinforcement learning are
known to suffer performance degradation when faced with out-of-distribution
scenarios. We propose that by properly accounting for the uncertainties of
pedestrians, a robot can learn safe navigation policies that are robust to
distribution shifts. Our method augments agent observations with prediction
uncertainty estimates generated by adaptive conformal inference, and it uses
these estimates to guide the agent's behavior through constrained reinforcement
learning. The system helps regulate the agent's actions and enables it to adapt
to distribution shifts. In the in-distribution setting, our approach achieves a
96.93% success rate, which is over 8.80% higher than the previous
state-of-the-art baselines with over 3.72 times fewer collisions and 2.43 times
fewer intrusions into ground-truth human future trajectories. In three
out-of-distribution scenarios, our method shows much stronger robustness when
facing distribution shifts in velocity variations, policy changes, and
transitions from individual to group dynamics. We deploy our method on a real
robot, and experiments show that the robot makes safe and robust decisions when
interacting with both sparse and dense crowds. Our code and videos are
