To\ngenerate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for\neach task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its\nassociated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint\nconfigurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the\ntransformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to\nthe first optimized joint configuration.

However, such constraints are often\nimplicit, context-dependent, and difficult to specify explicitly. In this work,\nwe present DRIVE, a novel framework for Dynamic Rule Inference and Verified\nEvaluation that models and evaluates human-like driving constraints from expert\ndemonstrations. DRIVE leverages exponential-family likelihood modeling to\nestimate the feasibility of state transitions, constructing a probabilistic\nrepresentation of soft behavioral rules that vary across driving contexts.\nThese learned rule distributions are then embedded into a convex\noptimization-based planning module, enabling the generation of trajectories\nthat are not only dynamically feasible but also compliant with inferred human\npreferences. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixed constraint forms or\npurely reward-based modeling, DRIVE offers a unified framework that tightly\ncouples rule inference with trajectory-level decision-making. It supports both\ndata-driven constraint generalization and principled feasibility verification.\nWe validate DRIVE on large-scale naturalistic driving datasets, including inD,\nhighD, and RoundD, and benchmark it against representative inverse constraint\nlearning and planning baselines. Experimental results show that DRIVE achieves\n0.0% soft constraint violation rates, smoother trajectories, and stronger\ngeneralization across diverse driving scenarios.

However, despite the availability of\nadvanced multi-agent frameworks, their real-world deployment on robots remains\nlimited, hindering the advancement of MARS research in practice. To bridge this\ngap, we conducted two studies to investigate performance trade-offs of\nhierarchical multi-agent frameworks in a simulated real-world multi-robot\nhealthcare scenario. In Study 1, using CrewAI, we iteratively refine the\nsystem's knowledge base, to systematically identify and categorize coordination\nfailures (e.g., tool access violations, lack of timely handling of failure\nreports) not resolvable by providing contextual knowledge alone. In Study 2,\nusing AutoGen, we evaluate a redesigned bidirectional communication structure\nand further measure the trade-offs between reasoning and non-reasoning models\noperating within the same robotic team setting. Drawing from our empirical\nfindings, we emphasize the tension between autonomy and stability and the\nimportance of edge-case testing to improve system reliability and safety for\nfuture real-world deployment.
