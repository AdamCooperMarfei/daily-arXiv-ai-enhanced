TL;DR: 通用型围教学习算法在四足机器人动态运动场景中取得了与专家策略相当的性能，而训练需要的机器人数量仅为对方的25%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四足机器人在复杂地形上有显著优势，但传统控制方法对滑刷和绞倒等问题的建模复杂度高，需要更简洁的解决方案

Method: 采用围教学习算法，通过尝试错误学习最优控制策略，避免了传统建模方法的复杂性

Result: 学习到的策略在性能上可与最先进的专家策略相比拼，而训练效率提升了4倍（仅需25%的机器人数量）

Conclusion: 围教学习提供了一种高效的通用性解决方案，能够在减少训练资源的同时实现优异的四足机器人动态运动控制

Abstract: Climbing, crouching, bridging gaps, and walking up stairs are just a few of
the advantages that quadruped robots have over wheeled robots, making them more
suitable for navigating rough and unstructured terrain. However, executing such
manoeuvres requires precise temporal coordination and complex agent-environment
interactions. Moreover, legged locomotion is inherently more prone to slippage
and tripping, and the classical approach of modeling such cases to design a
robust controller thus quickly becomes impractical. In contrast, reinforcement
learning offers a compelling solution by enabling optimal control through trial
and error. We present a generalist reinforcement learning algorithm for
quadrupedal agents in dynamic motion scenarios. The learned policy rivals
state-of-the-art specialist policies trained using a mixture of experts
approach, while using only 25% as many agents during training. Our experiments
also highlight the key components of the generalist locomotion policy and the
primary factors contributing to its success.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过NAO机器人实验研究了情感对齐在人机交互中的影响，发现情感对齐虽然不影响用户沟通风格和说服效果，但显著提高了用户对机器人心智状态和共情能力的归因


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究情感对齐作为共情沟通的前提条件，在人机交互中的影响效果

Method: 使用NAO机器人进行实验，对42名参与者进行两种条件对比：中性沟通和情感适配沟通，测量机器人的说服效果、用户沟通风格和心智状态归因

Result: 情感对齐对用户沟通风格和说服效果没有显著影响，但显著提高了用户对机器人心智状态和共情能力的归因

Conclusion: 情感对齐在人机交互中虽然不能提高说服效果，但能够有效提升机器人的人性化感知，对于建立更自然的人机交互具有重要意义

Abstract: The paper presents an experiment on the effects of adaptive emotional
alignment between agents, considered a prerequisite for empathic communication,
in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI). Using the NAO robot, we investigate the
impact of an emotionally aligned, empathic, dialogue on these aspects: (i) the
robot's persuasive effectiveness, (ii) the user's communication style, and
(iii) the attribution of mental states and empathy to the robot. In an
experiment with 42 participants, two conditions were compared: one with neutral
communication and another where the robot provided responses adapted to the
emotions expressed by the users. The results show that emotional alignment does
not influence users' communication styles or have a persuasive effect. However,
it significantly influences attribution of mental states to the robot and its
perceived empathy

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文探讨了使用虚拟现实和数字孪生技术实现机器人尸检活检的远程规划和控制系统，通过人体尸体实验验证了系统的精确性和可行性。


<details>

Result: 在三个尸体上进行了132次针头插入，离轴针头放置误差为5.30±3.25毫米，成功活检组织样本并通过组织病理学验证。

Conclusion: 用户报告针头放置方法非常直观，表明该系统是传统方法的有前景、精确且低风险的替代方案。

Abstract: Studying tissue samples obtained during autopsies is the gold standard when
diagnosing the cause of death and for understanding disease pathophysiology.
Recently, the interest in post mortem minimally invasive biopsies has grown
which is a less destructive approach in comparison to an open autopsy and
reduces the risk of infection. While manual biopsies under ultrasound guidance
are more widely performed, robotic post mortem biopsies have been recently
proposed. This approach can further reduce the risk of infection for
physicians. However, planning of the procedure and control of the robot need to
be efficient and usable. We explore a virtual reality setup with a digital twin
to realize fully remote planning and control of robotic post mortem biopsies.
The setup is evaluated with forensic pathologists in a usability study for
three interaction methods. Furthermore, we evaluate clinical feasibility and
evaluate the system with three human cadavers. Overall, 132 needle insertions
were performed with an off-axis needle placement error of 5.30+-3.25 mm. Tissue
samples were successfully biopsied and histopathologically verified. Users
reported a very intuitive needle placement approach, indicating that the system
is a promising, precise, and low-risk alternative to conventional approaches.

### [4] [Improving the Resilience of Quadrotors in Underground Environments by Combining Learning-based and Safety Controllers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02808)
*Isaac Ronald Ward,Mark Paral,Kristopher Riordan,Mykel J. Kochenderfer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合学习控制器和安全控制器的方案，通过正规化流前置进行环境分布监测，在地下环境中实现四旋翼机的安全自主导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习基于控制器在大规模地下环境中应用潜力巨大，但存在分布外环境不适应问题，需要一种能够结合学习控制器效率和安全控制器可靠性的方案。

Method: 使用正规化流训练环境前置分布，通过运行时监测四旋翼机的分布偏离程度，在过度分布时自动切换学习控制器和安全控制器。

Result: 在基于DARPA地下挑战赛真实数据的模拟洞穴环境中进行点到点导航测试，结果显示结合控制器既保持了学习控制器的高效性，又确保了安全控制器的避撕能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了学习控制器在分布外环境中的适应性问题，为地下环境中的四旋翼机自主导航提供了一种既安全又高效的控制方案。

Abstract: Autonomously controlling quadrotors in large-scale subterranean environments
is applicable to many areas such as environmental surveying, mining operations,
and search and rescue. Learning-based controllers represent an appealing
approach to autonomy, but are known to not generalize well to
`out-of-distribution' environments not encountered during training. In this
work, we train a normalizing flow-based prior over the environment, which
provides a measure of how far out-of-distribution the quadrotor is at any given
time. We use this measure as a runtime monitor, allowing us to switch between a
learning-based controller and a safe controller when we are sufficiently
out-of-distribution. Our methods are benchmarked on a point-to-point navigation
task in a simulated 3D cave environment based on real-world point cloud data
from the DARPA Subterranean Challenge Final Event Dataset. Our experimental
results show that our combined controller simultaneously possesses the liveness
of the learning-based controller (completing the task quickly) and the safety
of the safety controller (avoiding collision).

### [6] [Robotic 3D Flower Pose Estimation for Small-Scale Urban Farms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02870)
*Harsh Muriki,Hong Ray Teo,Ved Sengupta,Ai-Ping Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

Result: 成功检测约80%的花卉，平均姿态误差为7.7度，性能足以支持机器人授粉应用，与先前研究结果相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为低成本机器人平台上的植物表型分析提供了有效解决方案，特别是在花卉姿态估计方面表现出色，代码已开源供社区使用。

Abstract: The small scale of urban farms and the commercial availability of low-cost
robots (such as the FarmBot) that automate simple tending tasks enable an
accessible platform for plant phenotyping. We have used a FarmBot with a custom
camera end-effector to estimate strawberry plant flower pose (for robotic
pollination) from acquired 3D point cloud models. We describe a novel algorithm
that translates individual occupancy grids along orthogonal axes of a point
cloud to obtain 2D images corresponding to the six viewpoints. For each image,
2D object detection models for flowers are used to identify 2D bounding boxes
which can be converted into the 3D space to extract flower point clouds. Pose
estimation is performed by fitting three shapes (superellipsoids, paraboloids
and planes) to the flower point clouds and compared with manually labeled
ground truth. Our method successfully finds approximately 80% of flowers
scanned using our customized FarmBot platform and has a mean flower pose error
of 7.7 degrees, which is sufficient for robotic pollination and rivals previous
results. All code will be made available at
https://github.com/harshmuriki/flowerPose.git.

Result: 在完整规模工业机器操纵器上进行长时间干墙安装实验，验证了技能标准化方案和LLM基础的层次技能学习框架

Conclusion: 该方法能够以最小化的努力实现高质量的多任务重新编程，有效解决建筑行业机器人普遍性不足的挑战

Abstract: The quasi-repetitive nature of construction work and the resulting lack of
generalizability in programming construction robots presents persistent
challenges to the broad adoption of robots in the construction industry. Robots
cannot achieve generalist capabilities as skills learnt from one domain cannot
readily transfer to another work domain or be directly used to perform a
different set of tasks. Human workers have to arduously reprogram their
scene-understanding, path-planning, and manipulation components to enable the
robots to perform alternate work tasks. The methods presented in this paper
resolve a significant proportion of such reprogramming workload by proposing a
generalizable learning architecture that directly teaches robots versatile
task-performance skills through crowdsourced online natural language
instructions. A Large Language Model (LLM), a standardized and modularized
hierarchical modeling approach, and Building Information Modeling-Robot sematic
data pipeline are developed to address the multi-task skill transfer problem.
The proposed skill standardization scheme and LLM-based hierarchical skill
learning framework were tested with a long-horizon drywall installation
experiment using a full-scale industrial robotic manipulator. The resulting
robot task learning scheme achieves multi-task reprogramming with minimal
effort and high quality.

### [8] [IL-SLAM: Intelligent Line-assisted SLAM Based on Feature Awareness for Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02972)
*Haolan Zhang,Thanh Nguyen Canh,Chenghao Li,Ruidong Yang,Yonghoon Ji,Nak Young Chong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种特征感知机制来解决动态SLAM中特征不足的问题，通过仅在必要时激活线性特征来减少计算复杂度和应对低质量特征的挖法问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统动态SLAM系统在移除动态特征后导致特征不足，而现有方案不分情况地不断添加特征，造成了不必要的计算开销和性能下降。

Method: 设计了一种特征感知机制，评估当前特征是否足够，以决定是否激活线性特征支持。在后续处理中，引入的线性特征只用于辅助获取更好的初始相机位始，但排除在全局优化之外。

Result: 在TUM数据集上进行了大量实验，与ORB-SLAM3基准线和其他动态SLAM和多特征方法相比，ATE和RPE指标都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效解决动态SLAM中特征不足的挖法问题，通过智能地控制特征添加，在保持稳定性能的同时大大减少了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) plays a crucial role in
autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM methods, based on static environment
assumptions, struggle to handle complex dynamic environments. Recent dynamic
SLAM systems employ geometric constraints and deep learning to remove dynamic
features, yet this creates a new challenge: insufficient remaining point
features for subsequent SLAM processes. Existing solutions address this by
continuously introducing additional line and plane features to supplement point
features, achieving robust tracking and pose estimation. However, current
methods continuously introduce additional features regardless of necessity,
causing two problems: unnecessary computational overhead and potential
performance degradation from accumulated low-quality additional features and
noise. To address these issues, this paper proposes a feature-aware mechanism
that evaluates whether current features are adequate to determine if line
feature support should be activated. This decision mechanism enables the system
to introduce line features only when necessary, significantly reducing
computational complexity of additional features while minimizing the
introduction of low-quality features and noise. In subsequent processing, the
introduced line features assist in obtaining better initial camera poses
through tracking, local mapping, and loop closure, but are excluded from global
optimization to avoid potential negative impacts from low-quality additional
features in long-term process. Extensive experiments on TUM datasets
demonstrate substantial improvements in both ATE and RPE metrics compared to
ORB-SLAM3 baseline and superior performance over other dynamic SLAM and
multi-feature methods.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出DUViN方法，通过知识迁移的深度特征实现水下视觉导航，无需预建地图即可进行4自由度运动控制，解决了水下数据稀缺和领域迁移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主导航面临传感能力有限和水下环境建图困难等挑战，同时大规模水下导航数据集难以收集，需要解决从空中到水下环境的领域迁移问题

Method: 采用两阶段训练框架：首先在空域数据集上使用预训练深度特征提取器训练扩散视觉导航策略；然后在深度估计任务上重新训练提取器，并将其集成到已训练的导航策略中

Result: 在模拟和真实水下环境中的实验证明了该方法的有效性和泛化能力

Conclusion: DUViN方法通过知识迁移策略成功实现了水下视觉导航，解决了数据稀缺和领域迁移问题，为水下自主导航提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Autonomous underwater navigation remains a challenging problem due to limited
sensing capabilities and the difficulty of constructing accurate maps in
underwater environments. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion-based Underwater
Visual Navigation policy via knowledge-transferred depth features, named DUViN,
which enables vision-based end-to-end 4-DoF motion control for underwater
vehicles in unknown environments. DUViN guides the vehicle to avoid obstacles
and maintain a safe and perception awareness altitude relative to the terrain
without relying on pre-built maps. To address the difficulty of collecting
large-scale underwater navigation datasets, we propose a method that ensures
robust generalization under domain shifts from in-air to underwater
environments by leveraging depth features and introducing a novel model
transfer strategy. Specifically, our training framework consists of two phases:
we first train the diffusion-based visual navigation policy on in-air datasets
using a pre-trained depth feature extractor. Secondly, we retrain the extractor
on an underwater depth estimation task and integrate the adapted extractor into
the trained navigation policy from the first step. Experiments in both
simulated and real-world underwater environments demonstrate the effectiveness
and generalization of our approach. The experimental videos are available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 轮式双足机器人的探触触发盲升桌框架(CTBC)，通过轮子-障碍物探测触发腿部抬起动作，使得机器人能够仅靠本体感知可靠过超过轮子半径的障碍物


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮式双足机器人在平坦地形上具有高速移动优势，但在复杂环境(如楼梯)上的性能不如传统足式机器人，需要提升其跨越非结构化地形的能力

Method: 提出CTBC框架，在检测到轮子-障碍物接触时触发腿部抬起动作，采用强导向前传轨迹让机器人快速掌握灵活的腿部抬起技能

Result: 在LimX Dynamics的轮式双足机器人Tron1上进行了实验验证，实际测试证明机器人可靠地升超过其轮子半径的障碍物，仅使用本体感知反馈

Conclusion: CTBC框架有效提升了轮式双足机器人在非结构化地形上的过障能力，为轮式双足机器人的应用扩展提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: In recent years, wheeled bipedal robots have gained increasing attention due
to their advantages in mobility, such as high-speed locomotion on flat terrain.
However, their performance on complex environments (e.g., staircases) remains
inferior to that of traditional legged robots. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a general contact-triggered blind climbing (CTBC) framework for wheeled
bipedal robots. Upon detecting wheel-obstacle contact, the robot triggers a
leg-lifting motion to overcome the obstacle. By leveraging a strongly-guided
feedforward trajectory, our method enables the robot to rapidly acquire agile
leg-lifting skills, significantly enhancing its capability to traverse
unstructured terrains. The approach has been experimentally validated and
successfully deployed on LimX Dynamics' wheeled bipedal robot, Tron1.
Real-world tests demonstrate that Tron1 can reliably climb obstacles well
beyond its wheel radius using only proprioceptive feedback.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出UT^3框架，通过不确定性感知的自监督任务优化测试时训练，在保持性能的同时大幅缩短推理时间，适用于自主系统的连续域迁移环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在域迁移环境下普遍性能不佳，而现有测试时训练方法需要多次前向和反向传播，导致推理时间大幅增加，不适合资源受限的真实机器人应用。

Method: 提出不确定性感知的自监督任务，利用量化的不确定性来选择性地应用测试时训练，并提供连续设置来控制训练频率。

Result: 在单目深度估计任务上，方法在保持与标准测试时训练相似性能的同时，显著缩短了推理时间。

Conclusion: UT^3框架能够有效处理连续域迁移挑战，同时满足真实世界应用对延迟的严格要求，为自主系统提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are increasingly being used in autonomous
systems. However, DNNs do not generalize well to domain shift. Adapting to a
continuously evolving environment is a safety-critical challenge inevitably
faced by all autonomous systems deployed to the real world. Recent work on
test-time training proposes methods that adapt to a new test distribution on
the fly by optimizing the DNN model for each test input using self-supervision.
However, these techniques result in a sharp increase in inference time as
multiple forward and backward passes are required for a single test sample (for
test-time training) before finally making the prediction based on the
fine-tuned features. This is undesirable for real-world robotics applications
where these models may be deployed to resource constraint hardware with strong
latency requirements. In this work, we propose a new framework (called UT$^3$)
that leverages test-time training for improved performance in the presence of
continuous domain shift while also decreasing the inference time, making it
suitable for real-world applications. Our method proposes an uncertainty-aware
self-supervision task for efficient test-time training that leverages the
quantified uncertainty to selectively apply the training leading to sharp
improvements in the inference time while performing comparably to standard
test-time training protocol. Our proposed protocol offers a continuous setting
to identify the selected keyframes, allowing the end-user to control how often
to apply test-time training. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method on a
dense regression task - monocular depth estimation.

*Yash Vyas,Matteo Bottin*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于闭链平面五条杆架构的力平衡操作器设计，包括2-DOF平面版本Forbal-2和5-DOF空间版本Forbal-5，通过力平衡设计显著减少关节扭矩和反力矩


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设计力平衡操作器以减少关节扭矩和反力矩，提高精度，适用于需要毫米级精度的应用场景

Method: 基于闭链平面五条杆架构进行模块化设计，考虑几何、运动学和动力学设计，满足力平衡条件并最大化工作空间，济几何原理求解逆运动学

Result: 平衡配置导致平均反力矩减少66%，平均关节扭矩减少79%（Forbal-2）和84%（Forbal-5），Forbal-2位置误差显著减少

Conclusion: 力平衡操作器设计能够有效减少关节扭矩和反力矩，适合需要毫米级精度的应用

Abstract: A force balanced manipulator design based on the closed chain planar five bar
linkage is developed and experimentally validated. We present 2 variants as a
modular design: Forbal-2, a planar 2-DOF manipulator, and its extension to
5-DOF spatial motion called Forbal-5. The design considerations in terms of
geometric, kinematic, and dynamic design that fulfill the force balance
conditions while maximizing workspace are discussed. Then, the inverse
kinematics of both variants are derived from geometric principles.
  We validate the improvements from force balancing the manipulator through
comparative experiments with counter mass balanced and unbalanced
configurations. The results show how the balanced configuration yields a
reduction in the average reaction moments of up to 66\%, a reduction of average
joint torques of up to 79\%, as well as a noticeable reduction in position
error for Forbal-2. For Forbal-5, which has a higher end effector payload mass,
the joint torques are reduced up to 84\% for the balanced configuration.
Experimental results validate that the balanced manipulator design is suitable
for applications where the reduction of joint torques and reaction
forces/moments helps achieve millimeter level precision.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 主动训练框架通过简洁的数据选择提升深度LiDAR测量计算模型的训练效率和演进性能，仅需原数据量的52%即可达到全数据集训练的效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度LiDAR测量计算模型需要大量多样化训练数据才能适应多样环境的问题，以提高训练效率和模型演进性能

Method: 提出主动训练框架，包括初始训练集选择(ITSS)和主动增量选择(AIS)两种策略：ITSS通过轨迹分析选择多样化序列，AIS利用场景重建和预测不一致性迭代选择复杂序列的训练样本

Result: 在多种数据集和天气条件下验证有效性，仅使用52%的序列量即可达到全数据集训练的性能水平

Conclusion: 该方法通过优化训练过程，为更灵活可靠的LiDAR测量计算系统奠定了基础，能够在多样环境条件下实现更高精度的定位

Abstract: Robust and efficient deep LiDAR odometry models are crucial for accurate
localization and 3D reconstruction, but typically require extensive and diverse
training data to adapt to diverse environments, leading to inefficiencies. To
tackle this, we introduce an active training framework designed to selectively
extract training data from diverse environments, thereby reducing the training
load and enhancing model generalization. Our framework is based on two key
strategies: Initial Training Set Selection (ITSS) and Active Incremental
Selection (AIS). ITSS begins by breaking down motion sequences from general
weather into nodes and edges for detailed trajectory analysis, prioritizing
diverse sequences to form a rich initial training dataset for training the base
model. For complex sequences that are difficult to analyze, especially under
challenging snowy weather conditions, AIS uses scene reconstruction and
prediction inconsistency to iteratively select training samples, refining the
model to handle a wide range of real-world scenarios. Experiments across
datasets and weather conditions validate our approach's effectiveness. Notably,
our method matches the performance of full-dataset training with just 52\% of
the sequence volume, demonstrating the training efficiency and robustness of
our active training paradigm. By optimizing the training process, our approach
sets the stage for more agile and reliable LiDAR odometry systems, capable of
navigating diverse environmental conditions with greater precision.

TL;DR: 比较了移动操作机器人的两种控制范式（耦合与解耦）和两种视觉反馈机制（VR与屏幕），发现VR会增加操作负担，耦合控制在工作负担相当的情况下可能带来更好的模仿学习性能


<details>

Motivation: 开发直观的遥操作界面对于移动操作机器人至关重要，需要在高维数据收集和降低操作员工作负担之间取得平衡，特别是在需要全身协调的复杂长时程任务中

Method: 系统评估了两种控制范式（耦合式集成臂操作与底座导航功能，解耦式分别控制）和两种视觉反馈机制（沉浸式VR和传统屏幕可视化），在复杂多阶段任务序列中进行测试

Result: 使用VR作为反馈方式会增加任务完成时间、认知工作负担和感知努力；耦合操作与解耦操作对用户工作负担相当，但初步实验表明耦合遥操作收集的数据能带来更好的模仿学习性能

Conclusion: 研究为如何以人为中心收集高质量、高维度的移动操作数据提供了有价值的见解，耦合控制范式在保持用户工作负担的同时可能提升后续学习性能

Abstract: Intuitive Teleoperation interfaces are essential for mobile manipulation
robots to ensure high quality data collection while reducing operator workload.
A strong sense of embodiment combined with minimal physical and cognitive
demands not only enhances the user experience during large-scale data
collection, but also helps maintain data quality over extended periods. This
becomes especially crucial for challenging long-horizon mobile manipulation
tasks that require whole-body coordination. We compare two distinct robot
control paradigms: a coupled embodiment integrating arm manipulation and base
navigation functions, and a decoupled embodiment treating these systems as
separate control entities. Additionally, we evaluate two visual feedback
mechanisms: immersive virtual reality and conventional screen-based
visualization of the robot's field of view. These configurations were
systematically assessed across a complex, multi-stage task sequence requiring
integrated planning and execution. Our results show that the use of VR as a
feedback modality increases task completion time, cognitive workload, and
perceived effort of the teleoperator. Coupling manipulation and navigation
leads to a comparable workload on the user as decoupling the embodiments, while
preliminary experiments suggest that data acquired by coupled teleoperation
leads to better imitation learning performance. Our holistic view on intuitive
teleoperation interfaces provides valuable insight into collecting
high-quality, high-dimensional mobile manipulation data at scale with the human
operator in mind. Project

Result: 参与者对交互感受正面，认为机器人能干、友好且支持性强，但也指出延迟响应和语音识别错误等限制。说服效果高度依赖上下文，参与者对礼貌、合理的建议和表情体态反应正面，但需要更个性化、上下文敏感的论据和更清晰的社交角色

Conclusion: 生成式社交机器人可以影响用户决策，但其效果取决于沟通细节和上下文相关性，建议优化框架以深入研究人机说服动态

Abstract: Integrating generative AI such as large language models into social robots
has improved their ability to engage in natural, human-like communication. This
study presents a method to examine their persuasive capabilities. We designed
an experimental framework focused on decision making and tested it in a pilot
that varied robot appearance and self-knowledge. Using qualitative analysis, we
evaluated interaction quality, persuasion effectiveness, and the robot's
communicative strategies. Participants generally experienced the interaction
positively, describing the robot as competent, friendly, and supportive, while
noting practical limits such as delayed responses and occasional
speech-recognition errors. Persuasiveness was highly context dependent and
shaped by robot behavior: participants responded well to polite, reasoned
suggestions and expressive gestures, but emphasized the need for more
personalized, context-aware arguments and clearer social roles. These findings
suggest that generative social robots can influence user decisions, but their
effectiveness depends on communicative nuance and contextual relevance. We
propose refinements to the framework to further study persuasive dynamics
between robots and human users.

Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive refurbishment of the interactive robotic
art installation Standards and Double Standards by Rafael Lozano-Hemmer. The
installation features an array of belts suspended from the ceiling, each
actuated by stepper motors and dynamically oriented by a vision-based tracking
system that follows the movements of exhibition visitors. The original system
was limited by oscillatory dynamics, resulting in torsional and pendulum-like
vibrations that constrained rotational speed and reduced interactive
responsiveness. To address these challenges, the refurbishment involved
significant upgrades to both hardware and motion control algorithms. A detailed
mathematical model of the flying belt system was developed to accurately
capture its dynamic behavior, providing a foundation for advanced control
design. An input shaping method, formulated as a convex optimization problem,
was implemented to effectively suppress vibrations, enabling smoother and
faster belt movements. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
improvements in system performance and audience interaction. This work
exemplifies the integration of robotics, control engineering, and interactive
art, offering new solutions to technical challenges in real-time motion control
and vibration damping for large-scale kinetic installations.

Conclusion: 并行计算的安全集约束MPC方法有效提升了非线性约束系统的安全保证和性能表现

Abstract: Ensuring constraint satisfaction is a key requirement for safety-critical
systems, which include most robotic platforms. For example, constraints can be
used for modeling joint position/velocity/torque limits and collision
avoidance. Constrained systems are often controlled using Model Predictive
Control, because of its ability to naturally handle constraints, relying on
numerical optimization. However, ensuring constraint satisfaction is
challenging for nonlinear systems/constraints. A well-known tool to make
controllers safe is the so-called control-invariant set (a.k.a. safe set). In
our previous work, we have shown that safety can be improved by letting the
safe-set constraint recede along the MPC horizon. In this paper, we push that
idea further by exploiting parallel computation to improve safety. We solve
several MPC problems at the same time, where each problem instantiates the
safe-set constraint at a different time step along the horizon. Finally, the
controller can select the best solution according to some user-defined
criteria. We validated this idea through extensive simulations with a 3-joint
robotic arm, showing that significant improvements can be achieved in terms of
safety and performance, even using as little as 4 computational cores.

Abstract: The utilization of robotic technology has gained traction in healthcare
facilities due to progress in the field that enables time and cost savings,
minimizes waste, and improves patient care. Digital healthcare technologies
that leverage automation, such as robotics and artificial intelligence, have
the potential to enhance the sustainability and profitability of healthcare
systems in the long run. However, the recent COVID-19 pandemic has amplified
the need for cyber-physical robots to automate check-ups and medication
administration. A robot nurse is controlled by the Internet of Things (IoT) and
can serve as an automated medical assistant while also allowing supervisory
control based on custom commands. This system helps reduce infection risk and
improves outcomes in pandemic settings. This research presents a test case with
a nurse robot that can assess a patient's health status and take action
accordingly. We also evaluate the system's performance in medication
administration, health-status monitoring, and life-cycle considerations.

Abstract: Advancements in onboard computing mean remote sensing agents can employ
state-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning at the edge. These
capabilities can be leveraged to unlock new rare, transient, and pinpoint
measurements of dynamic science phenomena. In this paper, we present an
automated workflow that synthesizes the detection of these dynamic events in
look-ahead satellite imagery with autonomous trajectory planning for a
follow-up high-resolution sensor to obtain pinpoint measurements. We apply this
workflow to the use case of observing volcanic plumes. We analyze
classification approaches including traditional machine learning algorithms and
convolutional neural networks. We present several trajectory planning
algorithms that track the morphological features of a plume and integrate these
algorithms with the classifiers. We show through simulation an order of
magnitude increase in the utility return of the high-resolution instrument
compared to baselines while maintaining efficient runtimes.

TL;DR: 研究发现Waymo开放运动数据集(WOMD)无法准确捕捉真实自动驾驶车辆的行为动态和交互，存在系统性低估驾驶行为变异性、风险和复杂性的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证WOMD数据集在自动驾驶行为分析中的有效性，因为该数据集存在专有后处理、缺乏误差量化以及轨迹分段等问题

Method: 使用凤凰城独立收集的L4级自动驾驶自然数据集(PHX)进行对比分析，包括信号交叉口排队、跟车和换道三种场景，采用SIMEX方法处理测量误差和DTW距离量化行为差异

Result: 所有场景下PHX数据的行为都超出了WOMD的行为范围，WOMD低估了短车头时距和急减速行为

Conclusion: 仅基于WOMD校准的行为模型可能系统性地低估自然驾驶的变异性、风险和复杂性，使用时需要谨慎并进行独立数据验证

Abstract: The Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) has become a popular resource for
data-driven modeling of autonomous vehicles (AVs) behavior. However, its
validity for behavioral analysis remains uncertain due to proprietary
post-processing, the absence of error quantification, and the segmentation of
trajectories into 20-second clips. This study examines whether WOMD accurately
captures the dynamics and interactions observed in real-world AV operations.
Leveraging an independently collected naturalistic dataset from Level 4 AV
operations in Phoenix, Arizona (PHX), we perform comparative analyses across
three representative urban driving scenarios: discharging at signalized
intersections, car-following, and lane-changing behaviors. For the discharging
analysis, headways are manually extracted from aerial video to ensure
negligible measurement error. For the car-following and lane-changing cases, we
apply the Simulation-Extrapolation (SIMEX) method to account for empirically
estimated error in the PHX data and use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distances to
quantify behavioral differences. Results across all scenarios consistently show
that behavior in PHX falls outside the behavioral envelope of WOMD. Notably,
WOMD underrepresents short headways and abrupt decelerations. These findings
suggest that behavioral models calibrated solely on WOMD may systematically
underestimate the variability, risk, and complexity of naturalistic driving.
Caution is therefore warranted when using WOMD for behavior modeling without
proper validation against independently collected data.
