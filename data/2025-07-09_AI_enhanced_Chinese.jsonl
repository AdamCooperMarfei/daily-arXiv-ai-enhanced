Concurrently, scaling data and model size has led to the\ndevelopment of capable language and vision foundation models, motivating\nlarge-scale efforts to create general-purpose robot foundation models. While\nthese models have garnered significant enthusiasm and investment, meaningful\nevaluation of real-world performance remains a challenge, limiting both the\npace of development and inhibiting a nuanced understanding of current\ncapabilities. In this paper, we rigorously evaluate multitask robot\nmanipulation policies, referred to as Large Behavior Models (LBMs), by\nextending the Diffusion Policy paradigm across a corpus of simulated and\nreal-world robot data. We propose and validate an evaluation pipeline to\nrigorously analyze the capabilities of these models with statistical\nconfidence. We compare against single-task baselines through blind, randomized\ntrials in a controlled setting, using both simulation and real-world\nexperiments. We find that multi-task pretraining makes the policies more\nsuccessful and robust, and enables teaching complex new tasks more quickly,\nusing a fraction of the data when compared to single-task baselines. Moreover,\nperformance predictably increases as pretraining scale and diversity grows.\nProject page: https://toyotaresearchinstitute.github.io/lbm1/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u5c55Diffusion Policy\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\uff08LBMs\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a8\u52a8\u901a\u7528\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55Diffusion Policy\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u62df\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5355\u4efb\u52a1\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "result": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u6210\u529f\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u4e14\u80fd\u66f4\u5feb\u5730\u6559\u6388\u590d\u6742\u65b0\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u968f\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027\u589e\u52a0\u800c\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u64cd\u4f5c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

In contrast, humans learn these properties through\ninteractive multi-sensor exploration. This work proposes fusing visual and\ntactile observations into a unified Gaussian Process Distance Field (GPDF)\nrepresentation for active perception of object properties. While primarily\nfocusing on geometry, this approach also demonstrates potential for modeling\nsurface properties beyond geometry. The GPDF encodes signed distance using\npoint cloud, analytic gradient and Hessian, and surface uncertainty estimates,\nwhich are attributes that common neural network shape representation lack. By\nutilizing a point cloud to construct a distance function, GPDF does not need\nextensive pretraining on large datasets and can incorporate observations by\naggregation. Starting with an initial visual shape estimate, the framework\niteratively refines the geometry by integrating dense vision measurements using\ndifferentiable rendering and tactile measurements at uncertain surface regions.\nBy quantifying multi-sensor uncertainties, it plans exploratory motions to\nmaximize information gain for recovering precise 3D structures. For the\nreal-world robot experiment, we utilize the Franka Research 3 robot\nmanipulator, which is fixed on a table and has a customized DIGIT tactile\nsensor and an Intel Realsense D435 RGBD camera mounted on the end-effector. In\nthese experiments, the robot explores the shape and properties of objects\nassumed to be static and placed on the table.

Accurate RCM tool control is vital for incorporating autonomous\nsubtasks like suturing, blood suction, and tumor resection into robotic\nsurgical procedures, reducing surgeon fatigue and improving patient outcomes.\nHowever, these cable-driven systems are subject to significant joint reading\nerrors, corrupting the kinematics computation necessary to perform control.\nAlthough visual tracking with endoscopic cameras can correct errors on in-view\njoints, errors in the kinematic chain prior to the insertion point are\nirreparable because they remain out of view. No prior work has characterized\nthe stability of control under these conditions. We fill this gap by designing\na provably stable tracking-in-the-loop controller for the out-of-view portion\nof the RCM manipulator kinematic chain. We additionally incorporate this\ncontroller into a bilevel control scheme for the full kinematic chain. We\nrigorously benchmark our method in simulated and real world settings to verify\nour theoretical findings.

To address these challenges, this paper\nproposes a learning-based planning and control framework utilizing Bayesian\noptimization (BO), which develops a planning logic to ensure a smooth\ntransition and minimal velocity loss between inertia and sustained drift\nphases. BO is further employed to learn a performance-driven control policy\nthat mitigates modeling errors for enhanced system performance. Simulation\nresults on an 8-shape reference path demonstrate that the proposed framework\ncan achieve smooth and stable inertia drift through sharp corners.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u5728\u60ef\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u8def\u5f84\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u60ef\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u662f\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6025\u8f6c\u5f2f\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u4f46\u5feb\u901f\u8fc7\u6e21\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8bef\u5dee\u4f7f\u5176\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\u5f00\u53d1\u89c4\u5212\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u901f\u5ea6\u635f\u5931\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u4eff\u771f\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u57288\u5b57\u5f62\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5e73\u6ed1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u60ef\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u60ef\u6027\u6f02\u79fb\u4e2d\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u8d5b\u8f66\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Methods: We introduce a\ndeep-learning model to identify clinically relevant anatomical landmarks from a\ndepth image of the patient's neck, obtained using RGB-D camera, to autonomously\ndefine the scanning region and paths. Then, a robot motion planning framework\nis proposed to scan, segment, reconstruct, and localize vessels (veins and\narteries), followed by the identification of the optimal insertion zone.\nFinally, a needle guidance module plans the insertion under ultrasound guidance\nwith operator's feedback. This pipeline was validated on a high-fidelity\ncommercial phantom across 10 simulated clinical scenarios. Results: The\nproposed pipeline achieved 10 out of 10 successful needle placements on the\nfirst attempt. Vessels were reconstructed with a mean error of 2.15\n\\textit{mm}, and autonomous needle insertion was performed with an error less\nthan or close to 1 \\textit{mm}.
