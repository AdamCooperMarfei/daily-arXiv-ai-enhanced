### [1] [Closed-Form Robustness Bounds for Second-Order Pruning of Neural Controller Policies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02953)
*Maksym Shamrai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究了二阶剪枝方法（如OBD、OBS和SparseGPT）在非线性离散时间控制中对深度神经网络策略的影响，首次提出了数学上严格的鲁棒性分析，并推导了剪枝后控制误差的上界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络策略在机器人控制中表现出色，但其庞大的参数量与嵌入式微控制器的内存和实时性要求冲突。二阶剪枝方法虽在视觉和语言任务中有效，但其对闭环稳定性、跟踪精度和安全性的影响尚不明确。

Method: 通过分析剪枝后的权重扰动对控制策略的影响，推导了剪枝前后策略输出差异的闭式不等式，并提出了依赖于未剪枝谱范数和偏置的常数C_k(s)。

Result: 论文给出了剪枝幅度的最大允许值，确保控制误差不超过预设阈值，为安全关键自主系统提供了性能保证。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了深度学习工具与安全关键系统鲁棒性需求之间的关键空白，为剪枝方法在控制领域的应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Deep neural policies have unlocked agile flight for quadcopters, adaptive
grasping for manipulators, and reliable navigation for ground robots, yet their
millions of weights conflict with the tight memory and real-time constraints of
embedded microcontrollers. Second-order pruning methods, such as Optimal Brain
Damage (OBD) and its variants, including Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) and the
recent SparseGPT, compress networks in a single pass by leveraging the local
Hessian, achieving far higher sparsity than magnitude thresholding. Despite
their success in vision and language, the consequences of such weight removal
on closed-loop stability, tracking accuracy, and safety have remained unclear.
We present the first mathematically rigorous robustness analysis of
second-order pruning in nonlinear discrete-time control. The system evolves
under a continuous transition map, while the controller is an $L$-layer
multilayer perceptron with ReLU-type activations that are globally 1-Lipschitz.
Pruning the weight matrix of layer $k$ replaces $W_k$ with $W_k+\delta W_k$,
producing the perturbed parameter vector $\widehat{\Theta}=\Theta+\delta\Theta$
and the pruned policy $\pi(\cdot;\widehat{\Theta})$. For every input state
$s\in X$ we derive the closed-form inequality $
\|\pi(s;\Theta)-\pi(s;\widehat{\Theta})\|_2 \le C_k(s)\,\|\delta W_k\|_2, $
where the constant $C_k(s)$ depends only on unpruned spectral norms and biases,
and can be evaluated in closed form from a single forward pass. The derived
bounds specify, prior to field deployment, the maximal admissible pruning
magnitude compatible with a prescribed control-error threshold. By linking
second-order network compression with closed-loop performance guarantees, our
work narrows a crucial gap between modern deep-learning tooling and the
robustness demands of safety-critical autonomous systems.

Abstract: In the field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), a fundamental challenge is to
facilitate human understanding of robots. The emerging domain of eXplainable
HRI (XHRI) investigates methods to generate explanations and evaluate their
impact on human-robot interactions. Previous works have highlighted the need to
personalise the level of detail of these explanations to enhance usability and
comprehension. Our paper presents a framework designed to update and retrieve
user knowledge-memory models, allowing for adapting the explanations' level of
detail while referencing previously acquired concepts. Three architectures
based on our proposed framework that use Large Language Models (LLMs) are
evaluated in two distinct scenarios: a hospital patrolling robot and a kitchen
assistant robot. Experimental results demonstrate that a two-stage
architecture, which first generates an explanation and then personalises it, is
the framework architecture that effectively reduces the level of detail only
when there is related user knowledge.

### [3] [Image-driven Robot Drawing with Rapid Lognormal Movements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03166)

Conclusion: 该方法成功填补了图像空间目标与人类自然运动之间的鸿沟，为艺术家-机器人协作提供了更直观的工具。

Abstract: Large image generation and vision models, combined with differentiable
rendering technologies, have become powerful tools for generating paths that
can be drawn or painted by a robot. However, these tools often overlook the
intrinsic physicality of the human drawing/writing act, which is usually
executed with skillful hand/arm gestures. Taking this into account is important
for the visual aesthetics of the results and for the development of closer and
more intuitive artist-robot collaboration scenarios. We present a method that
bridges this gap by enabling gradient-based optimization of natural human-like
motions guided by cost functions defined in image space. To this end, we use
the sigma-lognormal model of human hand/arm movements, with an adaptation that
enables its use in conjunction with a differentiable vector graphics (DiffVG)
renderer. We demonstrate how this pipeline can be used to generate feasible
trajectories for a robot by combining image-driven objectives with a
minimum-time smoothing criterion. We demonstrate applications with generation
and robotic reproduction of synthetic graffiti as well as image abstraction.

Abstract: Replicating human--level dexterity remains a fundamental robotics challenge,
requiring integrated solutions from mechatronic design to the control of high
degree--of--freedom (DoF) robotic hands. While imitation learning shows promise
in transferring human dexterity to robots, the efficacy of trained policies
relies on the quality of human demonstration data. We bridge this gap with a
hand--arm teleoperation system featuring: (1) a 20--DoF linkage--driven
anthropomorphic robotic hand for biomimetic dexterity, and (2) an
optimization--based motion retargeting for real--time, high--fidelity
reproduction of intricate human hand motions and seamless hand--arm
coordination. We validate the system via extensive empirical evaluations,
including dexterous in-hand manipulation tasks and a long--horizon task
requiring the organization of a cluttered makeup table randomly populated with
nine objects. Experimental results demonstrate its intuitive teleoperation
interface with real--time control and the ability to generate high--quality
demonstration data. Please refer to the accompanying video for further details.

Result: 在动态四旋翼任务中，ADMM迭代减少63.4%，计算复杂度从O(n^3)降至O(n^2)，性能接近完全缓存重计算的70%。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了MPC的实时性和适应性，成功应用于微型四旋翼飞行器，并开源了实现。

Abstract: Recent advances in Model Predictive Control (MPC) leveraging a combination of
first-order methods, such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
(ADMM), and offline precomputation and caching of select operations, have
excitingly enabled real-time MPC on microcontrollers. Unfortunately, these
approaches require the use of fixed hyperparameters, limiting their
adaptability and overall performance. In this work, we introduce First-Order
Adaptive Caching, which precomputes not only select matrix operations but also
their sensitivities to hyperparameter variations, enabling online
hyperparameter updates without full recomputation of the cache. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our approach on a number of dynamic quadrotor tasks,
achieving up to a 63.4% reduction in ADMM iterations over the use of optimized
fixed hyperparameters and approaching 70% of the performance of a full cache
recomputation, while reducing the computational cost from O(n^3) to O(n^2)
complexity. This performance enables us to perform figure-eight trajectories on
a 27g tiny quadrotor under wind disturbances. We release our implementation
open-source for the benefit of the wider robotics community.

Abstract: The widespread use of consumer drones has introduced serious challenges for
airspace security and public safety. Their high agility and unpredictable
motion make drones difficult to track and intercept. While existing methods
focus on detecting current positions, many counter-drone strategies rely on
forecasting future trajectories and thus require more than reactive detection
to be effective. To address this critical gap, we propose an unsupervised
vision-based method for predicting the three-dimensional trajectories of
drones. Our approach first uses an unsupervised technique to extract drone
trajectories from raw LiDAR point clouds, then aligns these trajectories with
camera images through motion consistency to generate reliable pseudo-labels. We
then combine kinematic estimation with a visual Mamba neural network in a
self-supervised manner to predict future drone trajectories. We evaluate our
method on the challenging MMAUD dataset, including the V2 sequences that
feature wide-field-of-view multimodal sensors and dynamic UAV motion in urban
scenes. Extensive experiments show that our framework outperforms supervised
image-only and audio-visual baselines in long-horizon trajectory prediction,
reducing 5-second 3D error by around 40 percent without using any manual 3D
labels. The proposed system offers a cost-effective, scalable alternative for
real-time counter-drone deployment. All code will be released upon acceptance
to support reproducible research in the robotics community.

### [7] [Evaluation of an Uncertainty-Aware Late Fusion Algorithm for Multi-Source Bird's Eye View Detections Under Controlled Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03381)

Method: 通过向真实边界框注入受控噪声来隔离融合过程，并提出基于卡尔曼滤波的UniKF算法处理BEV检测的同步问题。

Result: UniKF在多种噪声水平下优于基线方法，定位和方向误差降低3倍，维度估计误差降低2倍，精度和召回率接近完美。

Conclusion: UniKF为多源融合提供了高效可靠的解决方案，显著提升了感知性能。

Abstract: Reliable multi-source fusion is crucial for robust perception in autonomous
systems. However, evaluating fusion performance independently of detection
errors remains challenging. This work introduces a systematic evaluation
framework that injects controlled noise into ground-truth bounding boxes to
isolate the fusion process. We then propose Unified Kalman Fusion (UniKF), a
late-fusion algorithm based on Kalman filtering to merge Bird's Eye View (BEV)
detections while handling synchronization issues. Experiments show that UniKF
outperforms baseline methods across various noise levels, achieving up to 3x
lower object's positioning and orientation errors and 2x lower dimension
estimation errors, while maintaining nearperfect precision and recall between
99.5% and 100%.

Abstract: Removing floating litter from water bodies is crucial to preserving aquatic
ecosystems and preventing environmental pollution. In this work, we present a
multi-robot aerial soft manipulator for floating litter collection, leveraging
the capabilities of aerial robots. The proposed system consists of two aerial
robots connected by a flexible rope manipulator, which collects floating litter
using a hook-based tool. Compared to single-aerial-robot solutions, the use of
two aerial robots increases payload capacity and flight endurance while
reducing the downwash effect at the manipulation point, located at the midpoint
of the rope. Additionally, we employ an optimization-based rope-shape planner
to compute the desired rope shape. The planner incorporates an adaptive
behavior that maximizes grasping capabilities near the litter while minimizing
rope tension when farther away. The computed rope shape trajectory is
controlled by a shape visual servoing controller, which approximates the rope
as a parabola. The complete system is validated in outdoor experiments,
demonstrating successful grasping operations. An ablation study highlights how
the planner's adaptive mechanism improves the success rate of the operation.
Furthermore, real-world tests in a water channel confirm the effectiveness of
our system in floating litter collection. These results demonstrate the
potential of aerial robots for autonomous litter removal in aquatic
environments.

### [9] [Coil Geometry Learning for Short-Range Magnetic Actuation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03806)
*Yuta Takahashi,Hayate Tajima,Shin-ichiro Sakai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于学习的磁场近似方法，用于燃料自由对接，解决了传统推进系统在近距离操作中的问题，并显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推进系统在近距离操作中可能导致传感器污染等问题，而磁场控制可以避免这些问题，但传统磁场模型在近距离时精度不足。

Method: 使用Biot-Savart定律的精确磁场模型（近场模型），并通过基于学习的方法近似磁场，以减少计算成本。

Result: 方法显著降低了精确磁场模型的计算成本，并在对接模拟中验证了有效性，同时具备可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该学习基方法为燃料自由对接提供了一种高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Fuel-free docking is a key operational technology for in-space assembly,
resupplying space stations, sample return missions, and formation keeping of
large-scale satellite swarms. The use of conventional propulsion systems,
including thrusters, can cause adverse effects at short distances, such as
sensor contamination, which may lead to the failure of the satellite or onboard
equipment. The magnetic field interaction control generated by magnetorquers
can overcome these weaknesses of propulsion. This actuation enables
simultaneous control of attitude and formation control among desired satellite
groups. The previous study typically uses the traditional dipole approximation
model of the exact magnetic field to reduce computation cost. However,
proximity operations often involve relatively short distances between
satellites, which can easily compromise the effectiveness of this
approximation. To avoid model errors that could result in satellite collisions,
we utilize a magnetic field model described by Biot-Savart's law, without
distance approximations (Near-field model), in consideration of short-distance
operations. To overcome the high computational cost associated with the coil
geometry and relative states information, a learning-based magnetic field
approximation is derived, and its effectiveness is shown in the docking
simulation of target and chaser satellites equipped with electromagnetic coils
on three axes. Our method significantly reduces the computational cost of the
exact magnetic model and possesses scalability that can accommodate an
increasing number of target satellites through parallel processing.

Abstract: Trajectory planning for robotic manipulators operating in dynamic orbital
debris environments poses significant challenges due to complex obstacle
movements and uncertainties. This paper presents Deep Koopman RRT (DK-RRT), an
advanced collision-aware motion planning framework integrating deep learning
with Koopman operator theory and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT). DK-RRT
leverages deep neural networks to identify efficient nonlinear embeddings of
debris dynamics, enhancing Koopman-based predictions and enabling accurate,
proactive planning in real-time. By continuously refining predictive models
through online sensor feedback, DK-RRT effectively navigates the manipulator
through evolving obstacle fields. Simulation studies demonstrate DK-RRT's
superior performance in terms of adaptability, robustness, and computational
efficiency compared to traditional RRT and conventional Koopman-based planning,

Method: 通过原始运动在线构建接触状态子流形，并映射到离线接触流形进行精确位姿估计。

Result: 在0.1至1.0毫米公差的五种工业几何上，成功率提升6倍至96.7%，同时降低了插入力和时间。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了装配效率和安全性，适用于复杂几何的精确装配。

Abstract: Robotic assembly of complex, non-convex geometries with tight clearances
remains a challenging problem, demanding precise state estimation for
successful insertion. In this work, we propose a novel framework that relies
solely on contact states to estimate the full SE(3) pose of a peg relative to a
hole. Our method constructs an online submanifold of contact states through
primitive motions with just 6 seconds of online execution, subsequently mapping
it to an offline contact manifold for precise pose estimation. We demonstrate
that without such state estimation, robots risk jamming and excessive force
application, potentially causing damage. We evaluate our approach on five
industrially relevant, complex geometries with 0.1 to 1.0 mm clearances,
achieving a 96.7% success rate - a 6x improvement over primitive-based
insertion without state estimation. Additionally, we analyze insertion forces,
and overall insertion times, showing our method significantly reduces the
average wrench, enabling safer and more efficient assembly.

Abstract: Recent advancements in imitation learning have shown promising results in
robotic manipulation, driven by the availability of high-quality training data.
To improve data collection efficiency, some approaches focus on developing
specialized teleoperation devices for robot control, while others directly use
human hand demonstrations to obtain training data.However, the former requires
both a robotic system and a skilled operator, limiting scalability, while the
latter faces challenges in aligning the visual gap between human hand
demonstrations and the deployed robot observations.To address this, we propose
a human hand data collection system combined with our hand-to-gripper
generative model, which translates human hand demonstrations into robot gripper
demonstrations, effectively bridging the observation gap.Specifically, a GoPro
fisheye camera is mounted on the human wrist to capture human hand
demonstrations.We then train a generative model on a self-collected dataset of
paired human hand and UMI gripper demonstrations, which have been processed
using a tailored data pre-processing strategy to ensure alignment in both
timestamps and observations.Therefore, given only human hand demonstrations, we
are able to automatically extract the corresponding SE(3) actions and integrate
them with high-quality generated robot demonstrations through our generation
pipeline for training robotic policy model.In experiments, the robust
manipulation performance demonstrates not only the quality of the generated
robot demonstrations but also the efficiency and practicality of our data
collection method.More demonstrations can be found at: https://rwor.github.io/

Abstract: Modular robotics holds immense potential for space exploration, where
reliability, repairability, and reusability are critical for cost-effective
missions. Coordination between heterogeneous units is paramount for precision
tasks -- whether in manipulation, legged locomotion, or multi-robot
interaction. Such modular systems introduce challenges far exceeding those in
monolithic robot architectures. This study presents a robust method for
synchronizing the trajectories of multiple heterogeneous actuators, adapting
dynamically to system variations with minimal system knowledge. This design
makes it inherently robot-agnostic, thus highly suited for modularity. To
ensure smooth trajectory adherence, the multidimensional state is constrained
within a hypersphere representing the allowable deviation. The distance metric
can be adapted hence, depending on the task and system under control,
deformation of the constraint region is possible. This approach is compatible
with a wide range of robotic platforms and serves as a core interface for
Motion-Stack, our new open-source universal framework for limb coordination
(available at https://github.com/2lian/Motion-Stack ). The method is validated
by synchronizing the end-effectors of six highly heterogeneous robotic limbs,
evaluating both trajectory adherence and recovery from significant external
disturbances.

Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) techniques enable robots to learn and
generalize tasks from user demonstrations, eliminating the need for coding
expertise among end-users. One established technique to implement LfD in robots
is to encode demonstrations in a stable Dynamical System (DS). However, finding
a stable dynamical system entails solving an optimization problem with bilinear
matrix inequality (BMI) constraints, a non-convex problem which, depending on
the number of scalar constraints and variables, demands significant
computational resources and is susceptible to numerical issues such as
floating-point errors. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
compositional approach that enhances the applicability and scalability of
learning stable DSs with BMIs.

Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative LiDAR-Inertial-Camera SLAM system with 3D
Gaussian Splatting, which is the first to jointly consider visual quality,
geometric accuracy, and real-time performance. It robustly and accurately
estimates poses while building a photo-realistic 3D Gaussian map in real time
that enables high-quality novel view RGB and depth rendering. To effectively
address under-reconstruction in regions not covered by the LiDAR, we employ a
lightweight zero-shot depth model that synergistically combines RGB appearance
cues with sparse LiDAR measurements to generate dense depth maps. The depth
completion enables reliable Gaussian initialization in LiDAR-blind areas,
significantly improving system applicability for sparse LiDAR sensors. To
enhance geometric accuracy, we use sparse but precise LiDAR depths to supervise
Gaussian map optimization and accelerate it with carefully designed
CUDA-accelerated strategies. Furthermore, we explore how the incrementally
reconstructed Gaussian map can improve the robustness of odometry. By tightly
incorporating photometric constraints from the Gaussian map into the
continuous-time factor graph optimization, we demonstrate improved pose
estimation under LiDAR degradation scenarios. We also showcase downstream
applications via extending our elaborate system, including video frame
interpolation and fast 3D mesh extraction. To support rigorous evaluation, we
construct a dedicated LiDAR-Inertial-Camera dataset featuring ground-truth

*Lingxiao Guo,Yue Gao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为ROLT的鲁棒运动变换器，通过身体标记化和一致性丢弃策略，提升了机器人在未见动态和感知条件下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究机器人在训练分布之外情况下的鲁棒运动问题，特别是动态和感知差异。

Method: 采用变换器模型的变体ROLT，引入身体标记化和一致性丢弃策略，增强泛化能力和抗噪声能力。

Result: 在四足和六足机器人实验中，ROLT在未见动态条件和噪声测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ROLT展示了在有限训练条件下对多种未见情况的强大泛化能力。

Abstract: To succeed in the real world, robots must deal with situations that differ
from those seen during training. Those out-of-distribution situations for
legged robot mainly include challenging dynamic gaps and perceptual gaps. Here
we study the problem of robust locomotion in such novel situations. While
previous methods usually rely on designing elaborate training and adaptation
techniques, we approach the problem from a network model perspective. Our
approach, RObust Locomotion Transformer(ROLT),a variation of transformer,could
achieve robustness in a variety of unseen conditions. ROLT introduces two key
designs: body tokenization and consistent dropout. Body tokenization supports
knowledge share across different limbs, which boosts generalization ability of
the network. Meanwhile, a novel dropout strategy enhances the policy's
robustness to unseen perceptual noise. We conduct extensive experiments both on
quadruped and hexapod robots. Results demonstrate that ROLT is more robust than
existing methods. Although trained in only a few dynamic settings, the learned
policy generalizes well to multiple unseen dynamic conditions. Additionally,
despite training with clean observations, the model handles challenging
corruption noise during testing.

*Nigitha Selvaraj,Alex Mitrevski,Sebastian Houben*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文探讨了模仿学习（IL）在室内导航中的可行性，通过专家演示训练多种导航策略网络，并与传统方法对比。结果表明IL在多模态数据下表现优越，但在动态环境中存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统室内机器人导航方法在复杂场景中缺乏灵活性或需要手动调整，而基于学习的方法能直接从数据中学习，更具适应性。然而，学习型方法很少与传统方法直接比较，影响其广泛接受。

Method: 使用专家（操纵杆）演示训练基于RGB图像、LiDAR及其组合的导航策略网络，并与传统势场导航方法对比。

Result: 多模态模型在大多数场景中表现出优越的导航能力，但在动态环境中面临挑战，可能因演示数据多样性不足。

Conclusion: IL能直接从数据中学习并适应不同布局，是一种实用的导航方法，并可能作为后续终身学习的初始化策略。

Abstract: Traditional indoor robot navigation methods provide a reliable solution when
adapted to constrained scenarios, but lack flexibility or require manual
re-tuning when deployed in more complex settings. In contrast, learning-based
approaches learn directly from sensor data and environmental interactions,
enabling easier adaptability. While significant work has been presented in the
context of learning navigation policies, learning-based methods are rarely
compared to traditional navigation methods directly, which is a problem for
their ultimate acceptance in general navigation contexts. In this work, we
explore the viability of imitation learning (IL) for indoor navigation, using
expert (joystick) demonstrations to train various navigation policy networks
based on RGB images, LiDAR, and a combination of both, and we compare our IL
approach to a traditional potential field-based navigation method. We evaluate
the approach on a physical mobile robot platform equipped with a 2D LiDAR and a
camera in an indoor university environment. Our multimodal model demonstrates
superior navigation capabilities in most scenarios, but faces challenges in
dynamic environments, likely due to limited diversity in the demonstrations.
Nevertheless, the ability to learn directly from data and generalise across
layouts suggests that IL can be a practical navigation approach, and
potentially a useful initialisation strategy for subsequent lifelong learning.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种运动任务中表现优于单智能体和多智能体基线，提升了平衡性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该框架有效实现了人形机器人手臂运动的协调控制，为复杂环境中的运动提供了鲁棒性。

Abstract: Humans naturally swing their arms during locomotion to regulate whole-body
dynamics, reduce angular momentum, and help maintain balance. Inspired by this
principle, we present a limb-level multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that enables coordinated whole-body control of humanoid robots
through emergent arm motion. Our approach employs separate actor-critic
structures for the arms and legs, trained with centralized critics but
decentralized actors that share only base states and centroidal angular
momentum (CAM) observations, allowing each agent to specialize in task-relevant
behaviors through modular reward design. The arm agent guided by CAM tracking
and damping rewards promotes arm motions that reduce overall angular momentum
and vertical ground reaction moments, contributing to improved balance during
locomotion or under external perturbations. Comparative studies with
single-agent and alternative multi-agent baselines further validate the
effectiveness of our approach. Finally, we deploy the learned policy on a
humanoid platform, achieving robust performance across diverse locomotion
tasks, including flat-ground walking, rough terrain traversal, and stair
climbing.

Conclusion: 沉浸式VR在精准农业中具有显著潜力，尤其在记忆引导和重复性任务中表现优异。

Abstract: This study explores the use of immersive virtual reality (VR) as a control
interface for agricultural robots in vineyard disease detection and treatment.
Using a Unity-ROS simulation, it compares three agents: a human operator, an
immersive VR-controlled robot, and a non-immersive VR-controlled robot. During
the scanning phase, humans perform best due to agility and control speed.
However, in the treatment phase, immersive VR robots outperform others,
completing tasks up to 65% faster by using stored infection data and optimized
path planning. In yield-map-based navigation, immersive robots are also 38%
faster than humans. Despite slower performance in manual scanning tasks,
immersive VR excels in memory-guided, repetitive operations. The study
highlights the role of interface design and path optimization, noting
limitations in simulation fidelity and generalizability. It concludes that
immersive VR has strong potential to enhance efficiency and precision in
precision agriculture.

*Abhijeet Behera,Sogol Kharrazi,Erik Frisk,Maytheewat Aramrattana*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 论文提出了三种改进的TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法，分别引入车辆航向信息、适应铰接式车辆以及允许恒定加速度，以更全面地预测碰撞风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTC$_{\text{2D}}$方法假设车辆航向相同且不变，且不适用于铰接式车辆，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 开发了三种改进版本：1）引入航向信息；2）适应铰接式车辆；3）允许恒定加速度。在CARLA仿真环境中测试。

Result: 改进方法不仅能检测追尾碰撞（类似TTC），还能识别侧碰风险（TTC无法预测）。

Conclusion: 三种改进方法扩展了TTC$_{\text{2D}}$的应用范围，提高了碰撞预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time-to-collision (TTC) is a widely used measure for estimating the time
until a rear-end collision between two vehicles, assuming both maintain
constant speeds and headings in the prediction horizon. To also capture
sideswipe collisions, a two-dimensional extension, TTC$_{\text{2D}}$, was
introduced. However, this formulation assumes both vehicles have the same
heading and that their headings remain unchanged during the manoeuvre, in
addition to the standard assumptions on the prediction horizon. Moreover, its
use for articulated vehicles like a tractor-semitrailer remains unclear. This
paper addresses these limitations by developing three enhanced versions of
TTC$_{\text{2D}}$. The first incorporates vehicle heading information, which is
missing in the original formulation. The standard assumption of constant speed
and heading in the prediction horizon holds. The second adapts this to
articulated vehicles while retaining the assumptions of the first version. The
third version maintains the constant heading assumption but relaxes the
constant speed assumption by allowing constant acceleration. The versions are
tested in a cut-in scenario using the CARLA simulation environment. They detect
rear-end collisions, similar to TTC, and moreover, they also identify sideswipe
risks, something TTC could not predict.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合运动学模型和强化学习，有效解决了局部最优问题，提升了四足机器人操纵器的控制性能。

Abstract: Equipping quadruped robots with manipulators provides unique
loco-manipulation capabilities, enabling diverse practical applications. This
integration creates a more complex system that has increased difficulties in
modeling and control. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising solution
to address these challenges by learning optimal control policies through
interaction. Nevertheless, RL methods often struggle with local optima when
exploring large solution spaces for motion and manipulation tasks. To overcome
these limitations, we propose a novel approach that integrates an explicit
kinematic model of the manipulator into the RL framework. This integration
provides feedback on the mapping of the body postures to the manipulator's
workspace, guiding the RL exploration process and effectively mitigating the
local optima issue. Our algorithm has been successfully deployed on a
DeepRobotics X20 quadruped robot equipped with a Unitree Z1 manipulator, and
extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of this
approach.

Motivation: 传统的导线排列设计方法过于简化，忽略了导线交叉等问题，难以应对复杂结构。

Method: 采用多目标黑盒优化方法，优化三维导线排列，确保导线不交叉且满足扭矩需求。

Result: 在三维链结构下优化导线排列，验证了方法的有效性并讨论了设计解决方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂结构中的导线排列设计提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Tendon-driven mechanisms are useful from the perspectives of variable
stiffness, redundant actuation, and lightweight design, and they are widely
used, particularly in hands, wrists, and waists of robots. The design of these
wire arrangements has traditionally been done empirically, but it becomes
extremely challenging when dealing with complex structures. Various studies
have attempted to optimize wire arrangement, but many of them have
oversimplified the problem by imposing conditions such as restricting movements
to a 2D plane, keeping the moment arm constant, or neglecting wire crossings.
Therefore, this study proposes a three-dimensional wire arrangement
optimization that takes wire crossings into account. We explore wire
arrangements through a multi-objective black-box optimization method that
ensures wires do not cross while providing sufficient joint torque along a
defined target trajectory. For a 3D link structure, we optimize the wire
arrangement under various conditions, demonstrate its effectiveness, and
discuss the obtained design solutions.

Method: 使用MILP框架调度双臂采摘任务，结合末端执行器的姿态覆盖分析，最大化采摘可达性。

Result: 双臂系统在果实密度均匀时效率接近单臂的两倍，仿真显示吞吐量提高10-20%，且停止次数显著减少。

Conclusion: 优化调度方法显著提升了植物工厂中机器人采摘的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Plant factory cultivation is widely recognized for its ability to optimize
resource use and boost crop yields. To further increase the efficiency in these
environments, we propose a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework
that systematically schedules and coordinates dual-arm harvesting tasks,
minimizing the overall harvesting makespan based on pre-mapped fruit locations.
Specifically, we focus on a specialized dual-arm harvesting robot and employ
pose coverage analysis of its end effector to maximize picking reachability.
Additionally, we compare the performance of the dual-arm configuration with
that of a single-arm vehicle, demonstrating that the dual-arm system can nearly
double efficiency when fruit densities are roughly equal on both sides.
Extensive simulations show a 10-20% increase in throughput and a significant
reduction in the number of stops compared to non-optimized methods. These
results underscore the advantages of an optimal scheduling approach in
improving the scalability and efficiency of robotic harvesting in plant
factories.

Result: 在两个数据集上显著优于四种基线方法，达到了轨迹细化的最新水平。

Conclusion: SRefiner通过引入拓扑关系，显著提升了轨迹预测的准确性，为自动驾驶系统提供了更可靠的决策支持。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of multi-agent future trajectories is crucial for
autonomous driving systems to make safe and efficient decisions. Trajectory
refinement has emerged as a key strategy to enhance prediction accuracy.
However, existing refinement methods often overlook the topological
relationships between trajectories, which are vital for improving prediction
precision. Inspired by braid theory, we propose a novel trajectory refinement
approach, Soft-Braid Refiner (SRefiner), guided by the soft-braid topological
structure of trajectories using Soft-Braid Attention. Soft-Braid Attention
captures spatio-temporal topological relationships between trajectories by
considering both spatial proximity and vehicle motion states at ``soft
intersection points". Additionally, we extend this approach to model
interactions between trajectories and lanes, further improving the prediction
accuracy. SRefiner is a multi-iteration, multi-agent framework that iteratively
refines trajectories, incorporating topological information to enhance
interactions within traffic scenarios. SRefiner achieves significant
performance improvements over four baseline methods across two datasets,
establishing a new state-of-the-art in trajectory refinement. Code is here

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局生成方法存在空间幻觉问题，如物体漂浮、重叠或堆叠关系错位，AutoLayout旨在通过自动化方法解决这些问题。

Method: AutoLayout采用双系统框架：慢系统通过RRG管道提取对象属性和空间约束，快系统生成坐标和拓扑关系并联合验证。引入LLM自适应的关系库（ARL）减少手工规则限制。

Result: 在8个场景中验证，AutoLayout在物理合理性、语义一致性和功能完整性上比SOTA方法提升10.1%。

Conclusion: AutoLayout通过慢-快协作推理和自验证机制，有效解决了布局生成中的空间幻觉问题，平衡了物理稳定性和语义一致性。

Abstract: The automated generation of layouts is vital for embodied intelligence and
autonomous systems, supporting applications from virtual environment
construction to home robot deployment. Current approaches, however, suffer from
spatial hallucination and struggle with balancing semantic fidelity and
physical plausibility, often producing layouts with deficits such as floating
or overlapping objects and misaligned stacking relation. In this paper, we
propose AutoLayout, a fully automated method that integrates a closed-loop
self-validation process within a dual-system framework. Specifically, a slow
system harnesses detailed reasoning with a Reasoning-Reflection-Generation
(RRG) pipeline to extract object attributes and spatial constraints. Then, a
fast system generates discrete coordinate sets and a topological relation set
that are jointly validated. To mitigate the limitations of handcrafted rules,
we further introduce an LLM-based Adaptive Relation Library (ARL) for
generating and evaluating layouts. Through the implementation of Slow-Fast
Collaborative Reasoning, the AutoLayout efficiently generates layouts after
thorough deliberation, effectively mitigating spatial hallucination. Its
self-validation mechanism establishes a closed-loop process that iteratively
corrects potential errors, achieving a balance between physical stability and
semantic consistency. The effectiveness of AutoLayout was validated across 8
distinct scenarios, where it demonstrated a significant 10.1% improvement over
SOTA methods in terms of physical plausibility, semantic consistency, and
functional completeness.

Result: 在振动平台和移动平台实验中，该方法在LiDAR受到强烈振动时表现优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 提出的后失真不确定性方法有效解决了高频振动导致的LiDAR失真问题，提升了定位精度。

Abstract: High-speed ground robots moving on unstructured terrains generate intense
high-frequency vibrations, leading to LiDAR scan distortions in Lidar-inertial
odometry (LIO). Accurate and efficient undistortion is extremely challenging
due to (1) rapid and non-smooth state changes during intense vibrations and (2)
unpredictable IMU noise coupled with a limited IMU sampling frequency. To
address this issue, this paper introduces post-undistortion uncertainty. First,
we model the undistortion errors caused by linear and angular vibrations and
assign post-undistortion uncertainty to each point. We then leverage this
uncertainty to guide point-to-map matching, compute uncertainty-aware
residuals, and update the odometry states using an iterated Kalman filter. We
conduct vibration-platform and mobile-platform experiments on multiple public
datasets as well as our own recordings, demonstrating that our method achieves
better performance than other methods when LiDAR undergoes intense vibration.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景和相机型号下同步误差小于10ms。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多事件相机的时间同步问题，无需额外硬件支持。

Abstract: Event cameras are a novel type of sensor designed for capturing the dynamic
changes of a scene. Due to factors such as trigger and transmission delays, a
time offset exists in the data collected by multiple event cameras, leading to
inaccurate information fusion. Thus, the collected data needs to be
synchronized to overcome any potential time offset issue. Hardware
synchronization methods require additional circuits, while certain models of
event cameras (e.g., CeleX5) do not support hardware synchronization.
Therefore, this paper proposes a hardware-free event camera synchronization
method. This method determines differences between start times by minimizing
the dissimilarity of the event density distributions of different event cameras
and synchronizes the data by adjusting timestamps. The experiments demonstrate
that the method's synchronization error is less than 10ms under various senses
with multiple models of event cameras.

Abstract: Lidar technology has been widely employed across various applications, such
as robot localization in GNSS-denied environments and 3D reconstruction. Recent
advancements have introduced different lidar types, including cost-effective
solid-state lidars such as the Livox Avia and Mid-360. The Mid-360, with its
dome-like design, is increasingly used in portable mapping and unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) applications due to its low cost, compact size, and reliable
performance. However, the lack of datasets that include dome-shaped lidars,
such as the Mid-360, alongside other solid-state and spinning lidars
significantly hinders the comparative evaluation of novel approaches across
platforms. Additionally, performance differences between low-cost solid-state
and high-end spinning lidars (e.g., Ouster OS series) remain insufficiently
examined, particularly without an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in odometry.
  To address this gap, we introduce a novel dataset comprising data from
multiple lidar types, including the low-cost Livox Avia and the dome-shaped
Mid-360, as well as high-end spinning lidars such as the Ouster series.
Notably, to the best of our knowledge, no existing dataset comprehensively
includes dome-shaped lidars such as Mid-360 alongside both other solid-state
and spinning lidars. In addition to the dataset, we provide a benchmark
evaluation of state-of-the-art SLAM algorithms applied to this diverse sensor
data. Furthermore, we present a quantitative analysis of point cloud
registration techniques, specifically point-to-point, point-to-plane, and
hybrid methods, using indoor and outdoor data collected from the included lidar
systems. The outcomes of this study establish a foundational reference for
future research in SLAM and 3D reconstruction across heterogeneous lidar
platforms.

Abstract: Policy learning focuses on devising strategies for agents in embodied
artificial intelligence systems to perform optimal actions based on their
perceived states. One of the key challenges in policy learning involves
handling complex, long-horizon tasks that require managing extensive sequences
of actions and observations with multiple modes. Wavelet analysis offers
significant advantages in signal processing, notably in decomposing signals at
multiple scales to capture both global trends and fine-grained details. In this
work, we introduce a novel wavelet policy learning framework that utilizes
wavelet transformations to enhance policy learning. Our approach leverages
learnable multi-scale wavelet decomposition to facilitate detailed observation
analysis and robust action planning over extended sequences. We detail the
design and implementation of our wavelet policy, which incorporates lifting
schemes for effective multi-resolution analysis and action generation. This
framework is evaluated across multiple complex scenarios, including robotic
manipulation, self-driving, and multi-robot collaboration, demonstrating the
effectiveness of our method in improving the precision and reliability of the
learned policy.

Abstract: Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive and safe brain
stimulation procedure with growing applications in clinical treatments and
neuroscience research. However, achieving precise stimulation over prolonged
sessions poses significant challenges. By integrating advanced robotics with
conventional TMS, robot-assisted TMS (Robo-TMS) has emerged as a promising
solution to enhance efficacy and streamline procedures. Despite growing
interest, a comprehensive review from an engineering perspective has been
notably absent. This paper systematically examines four critical aspects of
Robo-TMS: hardware and integration, calibration and registration,
neuronavigation systems, and control systems. We review state-of-the-art
technologies in each area, identify current limitations, and propose future
research directions. Our findings suggest that broader clinical adoption of
Robo-TMS is currently limited by unverified clinical applicability, high
operational complexity, and substantial implementation costs. Emerging
technologies, including marker-less tracking, non-rigid registration,
learning-based electric field (E-field) modelling, individualised magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) generation, robot-assisted multi-locus TMS (Robo-mTMS),
and automated calibration and registration, present promising pathways to
address these challenges.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型可见性感知模型预测路径积分框架（VA-MPPI），用于解决自主地面车辆在复杂、杂乱和无结构环境中的导航问题，通过隐式平衡探索与利用，显著提升了安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主地面车辆在有限视野和频繁遮挡的未知环境中导航时面临巨大挑战，传统方法依赖显式不确定性目标，效果有限。

Method: VA-MPPI将感知不确定性与控制决策结合，在统一规划和控制流程中推理不确定性演化，隐式优化系统性能。

Result: 在模拟实验中，VA-MPPI在复杂场景中显著减少碰撞，成功率高达84%（确定性控制器仅8%），且失败均因未满足停止条件而非碰撞。

Conclusion: VA-MPPI展示了在无结构和遮挡环境中实现鲁棒导航的潜力，为自主地面车辆系统的未来发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: Navigating complex, cluttered, and unstructured environments that are a
priori unknown presents significant challenges for autonomous ground vehicles,
particularly when operating with a limited field of view(FOV) resulting in
frequent occlusion and unobserved space. This paper introduces a novel
visibility-aware model predictive path integral framework(VA-MPPI). Formulated
as a dual control problem where perceptual uncertainties and control decisions
are intertwined, it reasons over perception uncertainty evolution within a
unified planning and control pipeline. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
explicit uncertainty objectives, the VA-MPPI controller implicitly balances
exploration and exploitation, reducing uncertainty only when system performance
would be increased. The VA-MPPI framework is evaluated in simulation against
deterministic and prescient controllers across multiple scenarios, including a
cluttered urban alleyway and an occluded off-road environment. The results
demonstrate that VA-MPPI significantly improves safety by reducing collision
with unseen obstacles while maintaining competitive performance. For example,
in the off-road scenario with 400 control samples, the VA-MPPI controller
achieved a success rate of 84%, compared to only 8% for the deterministic
controller, with all VA-MPPI failures arising from unmet stopping criteria
rather than collisions. Furthermore, the controller implicitly avoids
unobserved space, improving safety without explicit directives. The proposed
framework highlights the potential for robust, visibility-aware navigation in
unstructured and occluded environments, paving the way for future advancements
in autonomous ground vehicle systems.

Conclusion: 该方法在真实世界应用中具有实用性，F1TENTH车辆评估进一步验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Safe trajectory planning remains a significant challenge in complex
environments, where traditional methods often trade off computational
efficiency for safety. Comprehensive obstacle modeling improves safety but is
computationally expensive, while approximate methods are more efficient but may
compromise safety. To address this issue, this paper introduces a rapid and
safe trajectory planning framework based on state-based diffusion models.
Leveraging only low-dimensional vehicle states, the diffusion models achieve
notable inference efficiency while ensuring sufficient collision-free
characteristics. By composing diffusion models, the proposed framework can
safely generalize across diverse scenarios, planning collision-free
trajectories even in unseen scenes. To further ensure the safety of the
generated trajectories, an efficient, rule-based safety filter is proposed,
which selects optimal trajectories that satisfy both sufficient safety and
control feasibility from among candidate trajectories. Both in seen and unseen
scenarios, the proposed method achieves efficient inference time while
maintaining high safety and stability. Evaluations on the F1TENTH vehicle
further demonstrate that the proposed method is practical in real-world
applications. The project page is at: https://rstp-comp-diffuser.github.io/.

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, operating in environments with relatively few
obstacles, offer high maneuverability and full three-dimensional mobility. This
allows them to rapidly approach objects and perform a wide range of tasks often
challenging for ground robots, making them ideal for exploration, inspection,
aerial imaging, and everyday assistance. In this paper, we introduce AirStar, a
UAV-centric embodied platform that turns a UAV into an intelligent aerial
assistant: a large language model acts as the cognitive core for environmental
understanding, contextual reasoning, and task planning. AirStar accepts natural
interaction through voice commands and gestures, removing the need for a remote
controller and significantly broadening its user base. It combines geospatial
knowledge-driven long-distance navigation with contextual reasoning for
fine-grained short-range control, resulting in an efficient and accurate
vision-and-language navigation (VLN) capability.Furthermore, the system also
offers built-in capabilities such as cross-modal question answering,
intelligent filming, and target tracking. With a highly extensible framework,
it supports seamless integration of new functionalities, paving the way toward
a general-purpose, instruction-driven intelligent UAV agent. The supplementary

Conclusion: SimLauncher为利用大规模仿真预训练提升真实世界RL提供了概念验证。

Abstract: Autonomous learning of dexterous, long-horizon robotic skills has been a
longstanding pursuit of embodied AI. Recent advances in robotic reinforcement
learning (RL) have demonstrated remarkable performance and robustness in
real-world visuomotor control tasks. However, applying RL in the real world
faces challenges such as low sample efficiency, slow exploration, and
significant reliance on human intervention. In contrast, simulators offer a
safe and efficient environment for extensive exploration and data collection,
while the visual sim-to-real gap, often a limiting factor, can be mitigated
using real-to-sim techniques. Building on these, we propose SimLauncher, a
novel framework that combines the strengths of real-world RL and
real-to-sim-to-real approaches to overcome these challenges. Specifically, we
first pre-train a visuomotor policy in the digital twin simulation environment,
which then benefits real-world RL in two ways: (1) bootstrapping target values
using extensive simulated demonstrations and real-world demonstrations derived
from pre-trained policy rollouts, and (2) Incorporating action proposals from
the pre-trained policy for better exploration. We conduct comprehensive
experiments across multi-stage, contact-rich, and dexterous hand manipulation
tasks. Compared to prior real-world RL approaches, SimLauncher significantly
improves sample efficiency and achieves near-perfect success rates. We hope
this work serves as a proof of concept and inspires further research on
leveraging large-scale simulation pre-training to benefit real-world robotic
RL.

Conclusion: 该框架为感知驱动控制系统在现实视觉扰动下的安全性认证提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Perception-based neural network controllers are increasingly used in
autonomous systems that rely on visual inputs to operate in the real world.
Ensuring the safety of such systems under uncertainty is challenging. Existing
verification techniques typically focus on Lp-bounded perturbations in the
pixel space, which fails to capture the low-dimensional structure of many
real-world effects. In this work, we introduce a novel verification framework
for perception-based controllers that can generate outer-approximations of
reachable sets through explicitly modeling uncertain observations with
geometric perturbations. Our approach constructs a boundable mapping from
states to images, enabling the use of state-based verification tools while
accounting for uncertainty in perception. We provide theoretical guarantees on
the soundness of our method and demonstrate its effectiveness across benchmark
control environments. This work provides a principled framework for certifying
the safety of perception-driven control systems under realistic visual
perturbations.

Conclusion: VLM-TDP显著提升了扩散策略在复杂任务和噪声环境中的性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Diffusion policy has demonstrated promising performance in the field of
robotic manipulation. However, its effectiveness has been primarily limited in
short-horizon tasks, and its performance significantly degrades in the presence
of image noise. To address these limitations, we propose a VLM-guided
trajectory-conditioned diffusion policy (VLM-TDP) for robust and long-horizon
manipulation. Specifically, the proposed method leverages state-of-the-art
vision-language models (VLMs) to decompose long-horizon tasks into concise,
manageable sub-tasks, while also innovatively generating voxel-based
trajectories for each sub-task. The generated trajectories serve as a crucial
conditioning factor, effectively steering the diffusion policy and
substantially enhancing its performance. The proposed Trajectory-conditioned
Diffusion Policy (TDP) is trained on trajectories derived from demonstration
data and validated using the trajectories generated by the VLM. Simulation
experimental results indicate that our method significantly outperforms
classical diffusion policies, achieving an average 44% increase in success
rate, over 100% improvement in long-horizon tasks, and a 20% reduction in
performance degradation in challenging conditions, such as noisy images or
altered environments. These findings are further reinforced by our real-world
experiments, where the performance gap becomes even more pronounced in
long-horizon tasks. Videos are available on https://youtu.be/g0T6h32OSC8

Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) has been the industry standard for state
estimation problems over the past sixty years. The Invariant Extended Kalman
Filter (IEKF) is a recent development of the EKF for the class of group-affine
systems on Lie groups that has shown superior performance for inertial
navigation problems. The IEKF comes in two versions, left- and right- handed
respectively, and there is a perception in the robotics community that these
filters are different and one should choose the handedness of the IEKF to match
handedness of the measurement model for a given filtering problem. In this
paper, we revisit these algorithms and demonstrate that the left- and right-
IEKF algorithms (with reset step) are identical, that is, the choice of the
handedness does not affect the IEKF's performance when the reset step is
properly implemented. The reset step was not originally proposed as part of the
IEKF, however, we provide simulations to show that the reset step improves
asymptotic performance of all versions of the the filter, and should be
included in all high performance algorithms. The GNSS-aided inertial navigation
system (INS) is used as a motivating example to demonstrate the equivalence of
the two filters.

Conclusion: IDAGC框架为人机协作的全面发展提供了实用潜力。

Abstract: In Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC), which encompasses physical interaction
and remote cooperation, accurate estimation of human intentions and seamless
switching of collaboration modes to adjust robot behavior remain paramount
challenges. To address these issues, we propose an Intent-Driven Adaptive
Generalized Collaboration (IDAGC) framework that leverages multimodal data and
human intent estimation to facilitate adaptive policy learning across
multi-tasks in diverse scenarios, thereby facilitating autonomous inference of
collaboration modes and dynamic adjustment of robotic actions. This framework
overcomes the limitations of existing HRC methods, which are typically
restricted to a single collaboration mode and lack the capacity to identify and
transition between diverse states. Central to our framework is a predictive
model that captures the interdependencies among vision, language, force, and
robot state data to accurately recognize human intentions with a Conditional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) and automatically switch collaboration modes. By
employing dedicated encoders for each modality and integrating extracted
features through a Transformer decoder, the framework efficiently learns
multi-task policies, while force data optimizes compliance control and intent
estimation accuracy during physical interactions. Experiments highlights our
framework's practical potential to advance the comprehensive development of
HRC.

Abstract: Robust imitation learning for robot manipulation requires comprehensive 3D
perception, yet many existing methods struggle in cluttered environments. Fixed
camera view approaches are vulnerable to perspective changes, and 3D point
cloud techniques often limit themselves to keyframes predictions, reducing
their efficacy in dynamic, contact-intensive tasks. To address these
challenges, we propose PRISM, designed as an end-to-end framework that directly
learns from raw point cloud observations and robot states, eliminating the need
for pretrained models or external datasets. PRISM comprises three main
components: a segmentation embedding unit that partitions the raw point cloud
into distinct object clusters and encodes local geometric details; a
cross-attention component that merges these visual features with processed
robot joint states to highlight relevant targets; and a diffusion module that
translates the fused representation into smooth robot actions. With training on
100 demonstrations per task, PRISM surpasses both 2D and 3D baseline policies
in accuracy and efficiency within our simulated environments, demonstrating
strong robustness in complex, object-dense scenarios. Code and some demos are

Abstract: Navigation is a fundamental capacity for mobile robots, enabling them to
operate autonomously in complex and dynamic environments. Conventional
approaches use probabilistic models to localize robots and build maps
simultaneously using sensor observations. Recent approaches employ
human-inspired learning, such as imitation and reinforcement learning, to
navigate robots more effectively. However, these methods suffer from high
computational costs, global map inconsistency, and poor generalization to
unseen environments. This paper presents a novel method inspired by how humans
perceive and navigate themselves effectively in novel environments.
Specifically, we first build local frames that mimic how humans represent
essential spatial information in the short term. Points in local frames are
hybrid representations, including spatial information and learned features,
so-called spatial-implicit local frames. Then, we integrate spatial-implicit
local frames into the global topological map represented as a factor graph.
Lastly, we developed a novel navigation algorithm based on Rapid-Exploring
Random Tree Star (RRT*) that leverages spatial-implicit local frames and the
topological map to navigate effectively in environments. To validate our
approach, we conduct extensive experiments in real-world datasets and in-lab
environments. We open our source code at

Conclusion: DRAE为机器人终身学习提供了灵活、可扩展且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce Dynamic Retrieval-Augmented Expert Networks (DRAE), a
groundbreaking architecture that addresses the challenges of lifelong learning,
catastrophic forgetting, and task adaptation by combining the dynamic routing
capabilities of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE); leveraging the knowledge-enhancement
power of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG); incorporating a novel
hierarchical reinforcement learning (RL) framework; and coordinating through
ReflexNet-SchemaPlanner-HyperOptima (RSHO).DRAE dynamically routes expert
models via a sparse MoE gating mechanism, enabling efficient resource
allocation while leveraging external knowledge through parametric retrieval
(P-RAG) to augment the learning process. We propose a new RL framework with
ReflexNet for low-level task execution, SchemaPlanner for symbolic reasoning,
and HyperOptima for long-term context modeling, ensuring continuous adaptation
and memory retention. Experimental results show that DRAE significantly
outperforms baseline approaches in long-term task retention and knowledge
reuse, achieving an average task success rate of 82.5% across a set of dynamic
robotic manipulation tasks, compared to 74.2% for traditional MoE models.
Furthermore, DRAE maintains an extremely low forgetting rate, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in catastrophic forgetting mitigation. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enabling flexible, scalable,

precise obstacle avoidance, image-based semantic segmentation for
traversability assessment, and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to capture social
context and enable the robot to adhere to social norms in complex environments.
This multi-modal integration improves scene understanding and enhances
traversability, allowing the robot to adapt to diverse outdoor conditions. We

the left") offers a good balance between usability and information richness.
Previous research has shown that relative feedback can be used to enhance
policy search methods. However, these efforts have been limited to specific
policy classes and use feedback inefficiently. In this work, we introduce a
novel method to learn from relative feedback and combine it with off-policy
reinforcement learning. Through evaluations on two sparse-reward tasks, we
demonstrate our method can be used to improve the sample efficiency of
reinforcement learning by guiding its exploration process. Additionally, we
show it can adapt a policy to changes in the environment or the user's
preferences. Finally, we demonstrate real-world applicability by employing our
approach to learn a navigation policy in a sparse reward setting.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的、时间一致性的框架T²-VLM，通过跟踪视觉语言模型（VLM）生成的子目标状态变化来生成精确的奖励信号，用于机器人强化学习任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在机器人任务中缺乏领域特定的知识，且计算成本高，难以实时应用，因此需要一种无需微调的方法来生成准确的奖励信号。

Method: T²-VLM首先查询VLM以建立空间感知的子目标和初始完成度估计，然后使用贝叶斯跟踪算法动态更新目标完成状态，生成结构化奖励信号。

Result: 实验表明，T²-VLM在两个机器人操作基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，奖励准确性高且计算消耗低。

Conclusion: T²-VLM不仅改进了奖励生成技术，还为具身AI领域的发展做出了贡献。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have significantly improved
performance in embodied tasks such as goal decomposition and visual
comprehension. However, providing accurate rewards for robotic manipulation
without fine-tuning VLMs remains challenging due to the absence of
domain-specific robotic knowledge in pre-trained datasets and high
computational costs that hinder real-time applicability. To address this, we
propose $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM, a novel training-free, temporally consistent
framework that generates accurate rewards through tracking the status changes
in VLM-derived subgoals. Specifically, our method first queries the VLM to
establish spatially aware subgoals and an initial completion estimate before
each round of interaction. We then employ a Bayesian tracking algorithm to
update the goal completion status dynamically, using subgoal hidden states to
generate structured rewards for reinforcement learning (RL) agents. This
approach enhances long-horizon decision-making and improves failure recovery
capabilities with RL. Extensive experiments indicate that $\mathrm{T}^2$-VLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance in two robot manipulation benchmarks,
demonstrating superior reward accuracy with reduced computation consumption. We
believe our approach not only advances reward generation techniques but also
contributes to the broader field of embodied AI. Project website:

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IMMP的新方法，通过合并不同域的参数检查点来解决运动规划中的域适应问题，表现优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于代理交互和环境特征的差异，现有轨迹数据集难以有效用于目标域，传统方法存在域不平衡、灾难性遗忘和高计算成本等问题。

Method: IMMP采用两步过程：预合并以捕捉代理行为和交互，充分提取源域信息；合并以构建可适应模型，高效转移多样交互到目标域。

Result: 在多种规划基准和模型上评估，IMMP表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: IMMP通过合并参数检查点，有效解决了域适应问题，提升了运动规划性能。

Abstract: Motion planning is a crucial component of autonomous robot driving. While
various trajectory datasets exist, effectively utilizing them for a target
domain remains challenging due to differences in agent interactions and
environmental characteristics. Conventional approaches, such as domain
adaptation or ensemble learning, leverage multiple source datasets but suffer
from domain imbalance, catastrophic forgetting, and high computational costs.
To address these challenges, we propose Interaction-Merged Motion Planning
(IMMP), a novel approach that leverages parameter checkpoints trained on
different domains during adaptation to the target domain. IMMP follows a
two-step process: pre-merging to capture agent behaviors and interactions,
sufficiently extracting diverse information from the source domain, followed by
merging to construct an adaptable model that efficiently transfers diverse
interactions to the target domain. Our method is evaluated on various planning
benchmarks and models, demonstrating superior performance compared to
conventional approaches.

Result: 实验表明系统显著提高了操作安全性，同时不影响任务效率。

Conclusion: 该系统为杂乱环境中的精确遥操作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Teleoperating precise bimanual manipulations in cluttered environments is
challenging for operators, who often struggle with limited spatial perception
and difficulty estimating distances between target objects, the robot's body,
obstacles, and the surrounding environment. To address these challenges, local
robot perception and control should assist the operator during teleoperation.
In this work, we introduce a safe teleoperation system that enhances operator
control by preventing collisions in cluttered environments through the
combination of immersive VR control and voice-activated collision avoidance.
Using HTC Vive controllers, operators directly control a bimanual mobile
manipulator, while spoken commands such as "avoid the yellow tool" trigger
visual grounding and segmentation to build 3D obstacle meshes. These meshes are
integrated into a whole-body controller to actively prevent collisions during
teleoperation. Experiments in static, cluttered scenes demonstrate that our
system significantly improves operational safety without compromising task
efficiency.

Conclusion: 被动形状变量在非完整系统运动控制中具有重要作用，能够产生多稳态周期解，为机器人设计提供理论支持。

Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of many under-actuated wheeled platforms are governed
by nonholonomic constraints of no-skid for passively rolling wheels, coupled
with momentum balance. In most of theoretical models, the shape variables, i.e.
joint angles, are directly prescribed as periodic inputs, such as steering
angle of the Twistcar. In this work, we study a variant of the Twistcar model
where the actuation input is periodic oscillations of an inertial rotor
attached to the main body, while the steering joint is passively free to
rotate. Remarkably, the dynamics of this model is extremely rich, and includes
multiplicity of periodic solutions, both symmetric and asymmetric, as well as
stability transitions and bifurcations. We conduct numerical simulations as
well as asymptotic analysis of the vehicle's reduced equations of motion. We
use perturbation expansion in order to obtain leading-order dynamics under
symmetric periodic solution. Then, we utilize harmonic balance and further
scaling assumptions in order to approximate the conditions for
symmetry-breaking pitchfork bifurcation and stability transition of the
symmetric periodic solution, as a function of actuation frequency and
structural parameters. The asymptotic results show good agreement with
numerical simulations. The results highlight the role of passive shape
variables in generating multi-stable periodic solutions for nonholonomic
systems of robotic locomotion.

Result: 在零售环境中，机器人定位相对姿态误差为0.83米，对象映射位置误差为0.97米。

Conclusion: 系统高效、易部署，适用于商用机器人的视觉监控和对象映射。

Abstract: This paper presents Piggyback Camera, an easy-to-deploy system for visual
surveillance using commercial robot vacuums. Rather than requiring access to
internal robot systems, our approach mounts a smartphone equipped with a camera
and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) on the robot, making it applicable to any
commercial robot without hardware modifications. The system estimates robot
poses through neural inertial navigation and efficiently captures images at
regular spatial intervals throughout the cleaning task. We develop a novel
test-time data augmentation method called Rotation-Augmented Ensemble (RAE) to
mitigate domain gaps in neural inertial navigation. A loop closure method that
exploits robot cleaning patterns further refines these estimated poses. We
demonstrate the system with an object mapping application that analyzes
captured images to geo-localize objects in the environment. Experimental
evaluation in retail environments shows that our approach achieves 0.83 m
relative pose error for robot localization and 0.97 m positional error for
object mapping of over 100 items.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了检测的自动化水平和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are critical in the automated inspection of
wind turbine blades. Nevertheless, several issues persist in this domain.
Firstly, existing inspection platforms encounter challenges in meeting the
demands of automated inspection tasks and scenarios. Moreover, current blade
stop angle estimation methods are vulnerable to environmental factors,
restricting their robustness. Additionally, there is an absence of real-time
blade detail prioritized exposure adjustment during capture, where lost details
cannot be restored through post-optimization. To address these challenges, we
introduce a platform and two approaches. Initially, a UAV inspection platform
is presented to meet the automated inspection requirements. Subsequently, a
Fermat point based blade stop angle estimation approach is introduced,
achieving higher precision and success rates. Finally, we propose a blade
detail prioritized exposure adjustment approach to ensure appropriate
brightness and preserve details during image capture. Extensive tests,
comprising over 120 flights across 10 wind turbine models in 5 operational wind
farms, validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in enhancing
inspection autonomy.

Result: 实验证明TTTS在多种任务（如逆运动学、障碍物运动规划等）中高效且能收敛到全局最优解。

Conclusion: TTTS通过张量分解显著提升了优化效率，适用于广泛的机器人任务。

Abstract: Many robotic tasks, such as inverse kinematics, motion planning, and optimal
control, can be formulated as optimization problems. Solving these problems
involves addressing nonlinear kinematics, complex contact dynamics, and
long-horizon planning, each posing distinct challenges for state-of-the-art
optimization methods. To efficiently solve a wide range of tasks across varying
scenarios, researchers either develop specialized algorithms for the task to
achieve, or switch between different frameworks. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
is a general-purpose decision-making tool that enables strategic exploration
across problem instances without relying on task-specific structures. However,
MCTS suffers from combinatorial complexity, leading to slow convergence and
high memory usage. To address this limitation, we propose \emph{Tensor Train
Tree Search} (TTTS), which leverages tensor factorization to exploit the
separable structure of decision trees. This yields a low-rank,
linear-complexity representation that significantly reduces both computation
time and storage requirements. We prove that TTTS can efficiently reach the
bounded global optimum within a finite time. Experimental results across
inverse kinematics, motion planning around obstacles, multi-stage motion
planning, and bimanual whole-body manipulation demonstrate the efficiency of
TTTS on a diverse set of robotic tasks.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction is critical for safe autonomous navigation,
yet the impact of dataset design on model performance remains understudied.
This work systematically examines how feature selection, cross-dataset
transfer, and geographic diversity influence trajectory prediction accuracy in
multi-agent settings. We evaluate a state-of-the-art model using our novel L4
Motion Forecasting dataset based on our own data recordings in Germany and the
US. This includes enhanced map and agent features. We compare our dataset to
the US-centric Argoverse 2 benchmark. First, we find that incorporating
supplementary map and agent features unique to our dataset, yields no
measurable improvement over baseline features, demonstrating that modern
architectures do not need extensive feature sets for optimal performance. The
limited features of public datasets are sufficient to capture convoluted
interactions without added complexity. Second, we perform cross-dataset
experiments to evaluate how effective domain knowledge can be transferred
between datasets. Third, we group our dataset by country and check the
knowledge transfer between different driving cultures.

Abstract: In the field of robotics, researchers face a critical challenge in ensuring
reliable and efficient task planning. Verifying high-level task plans before
execution significantly reduces errors and enhance the overall performance of
these systems. In this paper, we propose an architecture for automatically
verifying high-level task plans before their execution in simulator or
real-world environments. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), our approach
consists of two key steps: first, the conversion of natural language
instructions into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL), followed by a comprehensive
analysis of action sequences. The module uses the reasoning capabilities of the
LLM to evaluate logical coherence and identify potential gaps in the plan.
Rigorous testing on datasets of varying complexity demonstrates the broad
applicability of the module to household tasks. We contribute to improving the
reliability and efficiency of task planning and addresses the critical need for
robust pre-execution verification in autonomous systems. The code is available

Abstract: The specification and validation of robotics applications require bridging
the gap between formulating requirements and systematic testing. This often
involves manual and error-prone tasks that become more complex as requirements,
design, and implementation evolve. To address this challenge systematically, we
propose extending behaviour-driven development (BDD) to define and verify
acceptance criteria for robotic systems. In this context, we use
domain-specific modelling and represent composable BDD models as knowledge
graphs for robust querying and manipulation, facilitating the generation of
executable testing models. A domain-specific language helps to efficiently
specify robotic acceptance criteria. We explore the potential for automated
generation and execution of acceptance tests through a software architecture
that integrates a BDD framework, Isaac Sim, and model transformations, focusing
on acceptance criteria for pick-and-place applications. We tested this
architecture with an existing pick-and-place implementation and evaluated the
execution results, which shows how this application behaves and fails
differently when tested against variations of the agent and environment. This
research advances the rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems,
contributing to their reliability and trustworthiness.

Motivation: 大语言模型在机器人任务规划中依赖文本输入，难以适应现实世界的变化和失败。

Method: LERa通过三个步骤（Look、Explain、Replan）利用视觉反馈进行重新规划，仅需原始RGB图像、自然语言指令、初始任务计划和失败检测。

Result: 在ALFRED-ChaOS和VirtualHome-ChaOS数据集上，LERa在动态环境中比基线方法提升40%性能；在PyBullet模拟器中，任务成功率提升高达67%。

Conclusion: LERa是一种鲁棒且适应性强的解决方案，适用于机器人任务执行中的错误感知和重新规划。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning,
but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world
changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look,
Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that
utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB
image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure
detection - without additional information such as object detection or
predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The
replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look, where LERa generates a
scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain, where it provides
corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan, where it modifies the plan accordingly.
LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from
both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the
newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40%
improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation
tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet
simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments,
including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's
effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable
solution for error-aware task execution in robotics. The code is available at

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic
environment leads to a 29.17% improvement in the average task success rate
across real-world tasks after reinforcement learning. Code, model and data will

Abstract: Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) in real-world settings requires agents
to process continuous visual streams and generate actions with low latency
grounded in language instructions. While Video-based Large Language Models
(Video-LLMs) have driven recent progress, current VLN methods based on
Video-LLM often face trade-offs among fine-grained visual understanding,
long-term context modeling and computational efficiency. We introduce
StreamVLN, a streaming VLN framework that employs a hybrid slow-fast context
modeling strategy to support multi-modal reasoning over interleaved vision,
language and action inputs. The fast-streaming dialogue context facilitates
responsive action generation through a sliding-window of active dialogues,
while the slow-updating memory context compresses historical visual states
using a 3D-aware token pruning strategy. With this slow-fast design, StreamVLN
achieves coherent multi-turn dialogue through efficient KV cache reuse,
supporting long video streams with bounded context size and inference cost.
Experiments on VLN-CE benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance with
stable low latency, ensuring robustness and efficiency in real-world

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.
