Modelling their\ninterface with human tissue is necessary to capture transmission of dynamic\nassistance. However, their nonlinear and compliant nature makes both physical\nmodeling and embedded sensing challenging. In this paper, we develop a\nimage-based, learning-based framework to estimate distributed contact forces\nfor a finger-exosuit system. We used the SoRoSim toolbox to generate a diverse\ndataset of exosuit geometries and actuation scenarios for training. The method\naccurately estimated interaction forces across multiple contact locations from\nlow-resolution grayscale images, was able to generalize to unseen shapes and\nactuation levels, and remained robust under visual noise and contrast\nvariations. We integrated the model into a feedback controller, and found that\nthe vision-based estimator functions as a surrogate force sensor for\nclosed-loop control.

The long denoising sequence for each action prediction\nimpedes effective reward propagation. Moreover, standard RL methods require\nmillions of real-world interactions, posing a major bottleneck for practical\nfine-tuning. Although prior work frames the denoising process in diffusion\npolicies as a Markov Decision Process to enable RL-based updates, its strong\ndependence on environment interaction remains highly inefficient. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce DiWA, a novel framework that leverages a world model for\nfine-tuning diffusion-based robotic skills entirely offline with reinforcement\nlearning. Unlike model-free approaches that require millions of environment\ninteractions to fine-tune a repertoire of robot skills, DiWA achieves effective\nadaptation using a world model trained once on a few hundred thousand offline\nplay interactions. This results in dramatically improved sample efficiency,\nmaking the approach significantly more practical and safer for real-world robot\nlearning. On the challenging CALVIN benchmark, DiWA improves performance across\neight tasks using only offline adaptation, while requiring orders of magnitude\nfewer physical interactions than model-free baselines. To our knowledge, this\nis the first demonstration of fine-tuning diffusion policies for real-world\nrobotic skills using an offline world model.

These challenges lead\nto vertical drift and non-semantic maps, hindering autonomous navigation.\n  This paper introduces Inland-LOAM, a LiDAR SLAM framework for waterways. It\nuses an improved feature extraction and a water surface planar constraint to\nmitigate vertical drift. A novel pipeline transforms 3D point clouds into\nstructured 2D semantic maps using voxel-based geometric analysis, enabling\nreal-time computation of navigational parameters like bridge clearances. An\nautomated module extracts shorelines and exports them into a lightweight,\nIENC-compatible format.\n  Evaluations on a real-world dataset show Inland-LOAM achieves superior\nlocalization accuracy over state-of-the-art methods. The generated semantic\nmaps and shorelines align with real-world conditions, providing reliable data\nfor enhanced situational awareness.
