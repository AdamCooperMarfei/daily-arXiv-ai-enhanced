To verify\nthis, we created two different test setups. One to highlight and isolate the\nreaction element of affective robot expressions, and one to investigate the\neffects of applying specific timing delays to a robot reacting to a physical\nencounter with a human. The first test was conducted with two different groups\n(n=84) of human observers, a test group and a control group both interacting\nwith the robot. The second test was performed with 110 participants using\nincreasingly longer reaction delays for the robot with every ten participants.\nThe results show a statistically significant change (p$<$.05) in perceived\naffective impact for the robots when they react to an event shared with a human\nobserver rather than reacting at random. The result also shows for shared\nphysical interaction, the near-human reaction times from the robot are most\nappropriate for the scenario. The paper concludes that a delay time around\n200ms may render the biggest impact on human observers for small-sized\nnon-humanoid robots. It further concludes that a slightly shorter reaction time\naround 100ms is most effective when the goal is to make the human observers\nfeel they made the biggest impact on the robot.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eab\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53cd\u5e94\u6765\u5f71\u54cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0200ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u975e\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c100ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5219\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u89c9\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "motivation": "\u63d0\u5347\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u793e\u4ea4\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63a2\u7a76\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u4eab\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53cd\u5e94\u5bf9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "method": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u7ec4\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff1a\u4e00\u7ec4\u9694\u79bb\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53cd\u5e94\u5143\u7d20\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u7ec4\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u7269\u7406\u4e92\u52a8\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5206\u522b\u670984\u540d\u548c110\u540d\u53c2\u4e0e\u8005\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5171\u4eab\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53cd\u5e94\u663e\u8457\u6539\u53d8\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u5176\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\uff08p<0.05\uff09\uff0c200ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5c0f\u578b\u975e\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c100ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u89c9\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002", "conclusion": "200ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5bf9\u5c0f\u578b\u975e\u4eba\u5f62\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6700\u6709\u6548\uff0c100ms\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5219\u8ba9\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u89c9\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\u3002"}}

While the Deep Deterministic Policy\nGradient (DDPG) algorithm excels in control tasks, its performance in maze\nnavigation suffers from sparse rewards, inefficient exploration, and\nlong-horizon planning difficulties, often leading to low success rates and\naverage rewards, sometimes even failing to achieve effective navigation. To\naddress these limitations, this paper proposes an efficient Hierarchical DDPG\n(HDDPG) algorithm, which includes high-level and low-level policies. The\nhigh-level policy employs an advanced DDPG framework to generate intermediate\nsubgoals from a long-term perspective and on a higher temporal scale. The\nlow-level policy, also powered by the improved DDPG algorithm, generates\nprimitive actions by observing current states and following the subgoal\nassigned by the high-level policy. The proposed method enhances stability with\noff-policy correction, refining subgoal assignments by relabeling historical\nexperiences. Additionally, adaptive parameter space noise is utilized to\nimprove exploration, and a reshaped intrinsic-extrinsic reward function is\nemployed to boost learning efficiency. Further optimizations, including\ngradient clipping and Xavier initialization, are employed to improve\nrobustness. The proposed algorithm is rigorously evaluated through numerical\nsimulation experiments executed using the Robot Operating System (ROS) and\nGazebo. Regarding the three distinct final targets in autonomous maze\nnavigation tasks, HDDPG significantly overcomes the limitations of standard\nDDPG and its variants, improving the success rate by at least 56.59% and\nboosting the average reward by a minimum of 519.03 compared to baseline\nalgorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u5316DDPG\uff08HDDPG\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u7ed3\u5408\u3001\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6807\u51c6DDPG\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u56e0\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u3001\u63a2\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u548c\u957f\u65f6\u89c4\u5212\u56f0\u96be\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u9700\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "method": "HDDPG\u91c7\u7528\u9ad8\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u751f\u6210\u5b50\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4f4e\u7ea7\u7b56\u7565\u6267\u884c\u52a8\u4f5c\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u79bb\u7b56\u7565\u6821\u6b63\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u4f18\u5316\u5956\u52b1\u51fd\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u5728ROS\u548cGazebo\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cHDDPG\u76f8\u6bd4\u57fa\u7ebf\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u81f3\u5c1156.59%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u5956\u52b1\u589e\u52a0\u81f3\u5c11519.03\u3002", "conclusion": "HDDPG\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86DDPG\u5728\u8ff7\u5bab\u5bfc\u822a\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

While recent methods explored distillation or alternative policy\nstructures to accelerate inference, these often demand additional training,\nwhich can be resource-intensive for large robotic models. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel approach inspired by the Real-Time Iteration (RTI) Scheme, a\nmethod from optimal control that accelerates optimization by leveraging\nsolutions from previous time steps as initial guesses for subsequent\niterations. We explore the application of this scheme in diffusion inference\nand propose a scaling-based method to effectively handle discrete actions, such\nas grasping, in robotic manipulation. The proposed scheme significantly reduces\nruntime computational costs without the need for distillation or policy\nredesign. This enables a seamless integration into many pre-trained\ndiffusion-based models, in particular, to resource-demanding large models. We\nalso provide theoretical conditions for the contractivity which could be useful\nfor estimating the initial denoising step. Quantitative results from extensive\nsimulation experiments show a substantial reduction in inference time, with\ncomparable overall performance compared with Diffusion Policy using full-step\ndenoising.

To handle diverse, task-directed dialog, and find\nsuccessful collaborative strategies that minimize human effort, MICoBot makes\ndecisions at three levels: (1) a meta-planner considers human dialog to\nformulate and code a high-level collaboration strategy, (2) a planner optimally\nallocates the remaining steps to either agent based on the robot's capabilities\n(measured by a simulation-pretrained affordance model) and the human's\nestimated availability to help, and (3) an action executor decides the\nlow-level actions to perform or words to say to the human. Our extensive\nevaluations in simulation and real-world -- on a physical robot with 18 unique\nhuman participants over 27 hours -- demonstrate the ability of our method to\neffectively collaborate with diverse human users, yielding significantly\nimproved task success and user experience than a pure LLM baseline and other\nagent allocation models.
