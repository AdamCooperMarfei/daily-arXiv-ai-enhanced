However, this approach captures only a\nsubset of the relevant information and can introduce detrimental\ndemonstrations, e.g., retrieving data from unrelated tasks due to similar scene\nlayouts, or selecting similar motions from tasks with divergent goals. We\npresent COLLAGE, a method for COLLective data AGgrEgation in few-shot imitation\nlearning that uses an adaptive late fusion mechanism to guide the selection of\nrelevant demonstrations based on a task-specific combination of multiple cues.\nCOLLAGE follows a simple, flexible, and efficient recipe: it assigns weights to\nsubsets of the dataset that are pre-selected using a single feature (e.g.,\nappearance, shape, or language similarity), based on how well a policy trained\non each subset predicts actions in the target demonstrations. These weights are\nthen used to perform importance sampling during policy training, sampling data\nmore densely or sparsely according to estimated relevance.

We present the robot's novel zero-wire design\nmethodology, which leads to its superior form factor, robustness,\nreplicability, and high performance. With a size and weight similar to a modern\nsmartphone, this standalone robot can walk for over an hour on a single battery\ncharge and survive meter-high drops with simple repairs. Its 300-dollar bill of\nmaterials includes minimal off-the-shelf components, readily available custom\nelectronics from online vendors, and structural parts that can be manufactured\non hobbyist 3D printers. A preliminary user assembly study confirms that Q8bot\ncan be easily replicated, with an average assembly time of under one hour by a\nsingle person. With heuristic open-loop control, Q8bot achieves a stable\nwalking speed of 5.4 body lengths per second and a turning speed of 5 radians\nper second, along with other dynamic movements such as jumping and climbing\nmoderate slopes.", "AI": {"tldr": "Q8bot\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u5f00\u6e90\u5fae\u578b\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u4e13\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u96f6\u7ebf\u7f06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u9ad8\u8010\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6613\u590d\u5236\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e3a\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e14\u6613\u4e8e\u590d\u5236\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5e73\u53f0\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u96f6\u7ebf\u7f06\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u73b0\u6210\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c3D\u6253\u5370\u7ed3\u6784\u90e8\u4ef6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5c0f\u578b\u5316\u3001\u8010\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6613\u7ec4\u88c5\u3002", "result": "Q8bot\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u5145\u7535\u540e\u53ef\u884c\u8d70\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u80fd\u627f\u53d7\u4e00\u7c73\u9ad8\u7684\u8dcc\u843d\uff0c\u7ec4\u88c5\u65f6\u95f4\u5c11\u4e8e\u4e00\u5c0f\u65f6\uff0c\u884c\u8d70\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe5.4\u4f53\u957f/\u79d2\u3002", "conclusion": "Q8bot\u662f\u4e00\u6b3e\u9002\u5408\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u6559\u80b2\u7684\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

To address these issues, we introduce a reference-free and Adverse\nweather condition-independent (Advent) framework (rather than a specific model\narchitecture) that can be implemented by various backbones and heads.

To address this,\nwe propose the Variational Flow-Matching Policy (VFP), which introduces a\nvariational latent prior for mode-aware action generation and effectively\ncaptures both task-level and trajectory-level multi-modality. VFP further\nincorporates Kantorovich Optimal Transport (K-OT) for distribution-level\nalignment and utilizes a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder for mode\nspecialization and efficient inference. We comprehensively evaluate VFP on 41\ntasks across four benchmark environments, demonstrating its effectiveness and\nsampling efficiency in both task and path multi-modality settings.

As one type of ferromagnetic soft continuums, the\nMagnetically Induced Metamorphic Materials (MIMMs)-based continuum (MC)\nexhibits similar bending behaviors. Based on the characteristics of its base\nmaterial, MC is flexible in modifying unit stiffness and convenient in molding\nfabrication. However, recent studies on magnetic continuum robots have\nprimarily focused on one or two design parameters, limiting the development of\na comprehensive magnetic continuum bending model. In this work, we constructed\ngraded-stiffness MCs (GMCs) and developed a numerical model for GMCs' bending\nperformance, incorporating four key parameters that determine their\nperformance. The simulated bending results were validated with real bending\nexperiments in four different categories: varying magnetic field,\ncross-section, unit stiffness, and unit length.

One key challenge\nhere is that the instructions for FORM are often under-specified and do not\nexplicitly specify the desired object goal poses. This paper presents SetItUp,\na neuro-symbolic framework that learns to specify the goal poses of objects\nfrom a few training examples and a structured natural-language task\nspecification. SetItUp uses a grounding graph, which is composed of abstract\nspatial relations among objects (e.g., left-of), as its intermediate\nrepresentation. This decomposes the FORM problem into two stages: (i)\npredicting this graph among objects and (ii) predicting object poses given the\ngrounding graph. For (i), SetItUp leverages large language models (LLMs) to\ninduce Python programs from a task specification and a few training examples.\nThis program can be executed to generate grounding graphs in novel scenarios.\nFor (ii), SetItUp pre-trains a collection of diffusion models to capture\nprimitive spatial relations and online composes these models to predict object\nposes based on the grounding graph.

Such manipulation requires both\neffectiveness -- reliable operation despite uncertain object structures -- and\nefficiency -- swift execution with minimal redundant steps and smooth actions.\nExisting approaches struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously: methods\nrelying on predefined kinematic models lack effectiveness when encountering\nstructural variations, while tactile-informed approaches achieve robust\nmanipulation without kinematic priors but compromise efficiency through\nreactive, step-by-step exploration-compensation cycles. This paper introduces\nTacMan-Turbo, a novel proactive tactile control framework for articulated\nobject manipulation that resolves this fundamental trade-off. Unlike previous\napproaches that treat tactile contact deviations merely as error signals\nrequiring compensation, our method interprets these deviations as rich sources\nof local kinematic information. This new perspective enables our controller to\npredict optimal future interactions and make proactive adjustments,\nsignificantly enhancing manipulation efficiency. In comprehensive evaluations\nacross 200 diverse simulated articulated objects and real-world experiments,\nour approach maintains a 100% success rate while significantly outperforming\nthe previous tactile-informed method in time efficiency, action efficiency, and\ntrajectory smoothness (all p-values < 0.0001).

This progress\ninspires researchers to explore fine-tuning these models with Reinforcement\nLearning (RL). However, fine-tuning VLA models with RL still faces challenges\nrelated to sample efficiency, compatibility with action chunking, and training\nstability. To address these challenges, we explore the fine-tuning of VLA\nmodels through offline reinforcement learning incorporating action chunking. In\nthis work, we propose Chunked RL, a novel reinforcement learning framework\nspecifically designed for VLA models. Within this framework, we extend temporal\ndifference (TD) learning to incorporate action chunking, a prominent\ncharacteristic of VLA models. Building upon this framework, we propose CO-RFT,\nan algorithm aimed at fine-tuning VLA models using a limited set of\ndemonstrations (30 to 60 samples). Specifically, we first conduct imitation\nlearning (IL) with full parameter fine-tuning to initialize both the backbone\nand the policy. Subsequently, we implement offline RL with action chunking to\noptimize the pretrained policy. Our empirical results in real-world\nenvironments demonstrate that CO-RFT outperforms previous supervised methods,\nachieving a 57% improvement in success rate and a 22.3% reduction in cycle\ntime.

The system model is considered to have uncertain model\nparameters. The key idea here is to utilize input/output data online to update\nthe model set containing the uncertain system parameter, as well as a dynamic\nestimated parameter of the model, so that the associated model estimation error\nreduces over time. This in turn improves the quality of the motion primitives\ngenerated by the lattice-based motion planner using a nominal estimated model\nselected on the basis of suitable criteria. The motion primitives are also\nequipped with tubes to account for the model mismatch between the nominal\nestimated model and the true system model, to guarantee collision-free overall\nmotion. The tubes are of uniform size, which is directly proportional to the\nsize of the model set containing the uncertain system parameter. The adaptive\nlearning module guarantees a reduction in the diameter of the model set as well\nas in the parameter estimation error between the dynamic estimated parameter\nand the true system parameter. This directly implies a reduction in the size of\nthe implemented tubes and guarantees that the utilized motion primitives go\narbitrarily close to the resolution-optimal motion primitives associated with\nthe true model of the system, thus significantly improving the overall motion\nplanning performance over time.

To handle these scenarios, the robot team is partitioned\ninto subgroups. Robots that remain connected form a communication group and\ncollaboratively plan using partially centralized nonlinear optimization.
