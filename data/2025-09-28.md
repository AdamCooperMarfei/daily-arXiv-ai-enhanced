*Sven Ochs,Philip Schörner,Marc René Zofka,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种融合相机语义分割与LiDAR分割的方法，通过将LiDAR点投影到相机语义分割空间来增强LiDAR定位的精度和可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR数据的语义分割面临不同传感器类型和配置的挑战，但语义信息可以显著提升基于LiDAR的自主移动系统定位技术的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: 使用CoCar NextGen平台的多传感器配置，采用Depth-Anything网络进行相机图像分割，自适应分割网络进行LiDAR分割，并将LiDAR点投影到相机语义分割空间。

Result: 在德国卡尔斯鲁厄进行了55公里的广泛测试，覆盖城市、多车道道路和乡村高速公路等多种环境，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges,
particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations.
However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the
accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous
mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data
with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points
into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the
precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline.
  For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research
Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and
configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis
of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art
Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive
segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground
truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite
System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK).
Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of
Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas,
multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way
for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in
complex real-world environments.

Abstract: This paper presents the initial results from our structured literature review
on applications of Formal Methods (FM) to Robotic Autonomous Systems (RAS). We
describe our structured survey methodology; including database selection and
associated search strings, search filters and collaborative review of
identified papers. We categorise and enumerate the FM approaches and formalisms
that have been used for specification and verification of RAS. We investigate
FM in the context of sub-symbolic AI-enabled RAS and examine the evolution of
how FM is used over time in this field. This work complements a pre-existing
survey in this area and we examine how this research area has matured over
time. Specifically, our survey demonstrates that some trends have persisted as
observed in a previous survey. Additionally, it recognized new trends that were
not considered previously including a noticeable increase in adopting Formal
Synthesis approaches as well as Probabilistic Verification Techniques.

### [3] [Boosting Zero-Shot VLN via Abstract Obstacle Map-Based Waypoint Prediction with TopoGraph-and-VisitInfo-Aware Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20499)
*Boqi Li,Siyuan Li,Weiyi Wang,Anran Li,Zhong Cao,Henry X. Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种零样本视觉语言导航框架，结合简化的路径点预测器和多模态大语言模型，在连续环境中实现高效的导航性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型和机器人技术的快速发展，视觉语言导航成为具身智能体的关键任务。连续环境下的VLN尤其具有挑战性，需要同时理解自然语言指令、感知环境和规划底层动作。

Method: 使用简化的路径点预测器在抽象障碍物地图上生成线性可达路径点，构建动态更新的拓扑图并记录访问历史。将图和访问信息编码到提示中，使MLLM能够进行空间结构和探索历史的推理。

Result: 在R2R-CE和RxR-CE数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了最先进的零样本性能，成功率分别达到41%和36%，超越了之前的先进方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过结合路径点预测和MLLM推理，在连续环境视觉语言导航中实现了优异的零样本性能，证明了其在具身智能应用中的有效性。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of foundation models and robotics, vision-language
navigation (VLN) has emerged as a key task for embodied agents with broad
practical applications. We address VLN in continuous environments, a
particularly challenging setting where an agent must jointly interpret natural
language instructions, perceive its surroundings, and plan low-level actions.
We propose a zero-shot framework that integrates a simplified yet effective
waypoint predictor with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). The predictor
operates on an abstract obstacle map, producing linearly reachable waypoints,
which are incorporated into a dynamically updated topological graph with
explicit visitation records. The graph and visitation information are encoded
into the prompt, enabling reasoning over both spatial structure and exploration
history to encourage exploration and equip MLLM with local path planning for
error correction. Extensive experiments on R2R-CE and RxR-CE show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, with success rates of
41% and 36%, respectively, outperforming prior state-of-the-art methods.

### [4] [MELEGROS: Monolithic Elephant-inspired Gripper with Optical Sensors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20510)
*Petr Trunin,Diana Cafiso,Anderson Brazil Nardin,Trevor Exley,Lucia Beccai*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: MELEGROS是一个受大象鼻子启发的软体抓取器，通过单一材料和连续3D打印将光学传感器与气动驱动结构集成，实现了多功能感知和生物灵巧操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受大象鼻子结构、驱动和感知无缝集成的启发，旨在开发一种将传感作为内在、共制造能力的软体抓取器，避免机械不匹配问题。

Method: 使用单一软树脂和连续3D打印，将6个光学波导传感器和5个气动腔直接集成到气动驱动晶格结构中，实现传感与结构的单材料制造。

Result: 仅需4次迭代即完成原型，可举起超过自身重量两倍的物体，执行捏取、舀取和伸展等生物启发动作，并能轻柔抓取葡萄等易碎物品。

Conclusion: MELEGROS展示了软体机器人的新范式，其中完全嵌入的传感和连续结构固有地支持多功能、生物启发的操作。

Abstract: The elephant trunk exemplifies a natural gripper where structure, actuation,
and sensing are seamlessly integrated. Inspired by the distal morphology of the
African elephant trunk, we present MELEGROS, a Monolithic ELEphant-inspired
GRipper with Optical Sensors, emphasizing sensing as an intrinsic,
co-fabricated capability. Unlike multi-material or tendon-based approaches,
MELEGROS directly integrates six optical waveguide sensors and five pneumatic
chambers into a pneumatically actuated lattice structure (12.5 mm cell size)
using a single soft resin and one continuous 3D print. This eliminates
mechanical mismatches between sensors, actuators, and body, reducing model
uncertainty and enabling simulation-guided sensor design and placement. Only
four iterations were required to achieve the final prototype, which features a
continuous structure capable of elongation, compression, and bending while
decoupling tactile and proprioceptive signals. MELEGROS (132 g) lifts more than
twice its weight, performs bioinspired actions such as pinching, scooping, and
reaching, and delicately grasps fragile items like grapes. The integrated
optical sensors provide distinct responses to touch, bending, and chamber
deformation, enabling multifunctional perception. MELEGROS demonstrates a new
paradigm for soft robotics where fully embedded sensing and continuous
structures inherently support versatile, bioinspired manipulation.

### [5] [Action-Informed Estimation and Planning: Clearing Clutter on Staircases via Quadrupedal Pedipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20516)
*Prasanna Sriganesh,Barath Satheeshkumar,Anushree Sabnis,Matthew Travers*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种感知-动作框架，使四足机器人能够在密集杂乱环境中通过单腿推动清除障碍物，特别解决了在推动过程中物体被遮挡时的状态估计问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人在密集杂乱环境中自主操作时，需要与障碍物进行物理交互来清理路径。但在挑战性地形（如杂乱的楼梯）上，单腿推动等紧密耦合的物理动作会产生难以在设计时预测的新约束，特别是物体在推动过程中被传感器遮挡的问题。

Method: 开发了紧密耦合的感知-动作框架，核心贡献是交互感知状态估计循环，利用本体感知反馈（足部接触和腿部位置）来预测物体在遮挡期间的位移，指导感知系统在交互后重新检测物体，实现动作与感知的闭环。

Result: 在波士顿动力Spot机器人上实施该方法，结果显示交互感知方法在楼梯上推动物体时相比开环基线具有更高的任务成功率和跟踪精度。

Conclusion: 该交互感知方法能够有效解决四足机器人在单腿推动过程中物体被遮挡的问题，通过本体感知反馈实现准确的状态估计和物体跟踪，提高了在挑战性环境中的操作性能。

Abstract: For robots to operate autonomously in densely cluttered environments, they
must reason about and potentially physically interact with obstacles to clear a
path. Safely clearing a path on challenging terrain, such as a cluttered
staircase, requires controlled interaction. For example, a quadrupedal robot
that pushes objects out of the way with one leg while maintaining a stable
stance with its three other legs. However, tightly coupled physical actions,
such as one-legged pushing, create new constraints on the system that can be
difficult to predict at design time. In this work, we present a new method that
addresses one such constraint, wherein the object being pushed by a quadrupedal
robot with one of its legs becomes occluded from the robot's sensors during
manipulation. To address this challenge, we present a tightly coupled
perception-action framework that enables the robot to perceive clutter, reason
about feasible push paths, and execute the clearing maneuver. Our core
contribution is an interaction-aware state estimation loop that uses
proprioceptive feedback regarding foot contact and leg position to predict an
object's displacement during the occlusion. This prediction guides the
perception system to robustly re-detect the object after the interaction,
closing the loop between action and sensing to enable accurate tracking even
after partial pushes. Using this feedback allows the robot to learn from
physical outcomes, reclassifying an object as immovable if a push fails due to
it being too heavy. We present results of implementing our approach on a Boston
Dynamics Spot robot that show our interaction-aware approach achieves higher
task success rates and tracking accuracy in pushing objects on stairs compared
to open-loop baselines.

### [6] [Selective Progress-Aware Querying for Human-in-the-Loop Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20541)
*Anujith Muraleedharan,Anamika J H*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SPARQ是一种基于学习进度的查询策略，只在学习停滞或恶化时请求人类反馈，显著减少了不必要的反馈请求，在保持高性能的同时节省了约一半的反馈预算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中人类反馈成本高昂且有限，现有的人机协同强化学习方法假设反馈充足，限制了在物理机器人部署中的实用性。

Method: 提出SPARQ策略，通过监测学习进度，仅在性能停滞或下降时请求人类反馈，避免不必要的查询。在PyBullet模拟环境中使用UR5机械臂进行立方体抓取任务评估。

Result: SPARQ实现了近乎完美的任务成功率，与始终查询的性能相当，但只消耗约一半的反馈预算。相比随机查询提供更稳定高效的学习，显著优于无反馈训练。

Conclusion: 选择性、基于进度的查询策略可以使人机协同强化学习在现实人类努力约束下更加高效和可扩展。

Abstract: Human feedback can greatly accelerate robot learning, but in real-world
settings, such feedback is costly and limited. Existing human-in-the-loop
reinforcement learning (HiL-RL) methods often assume abundant feedback,
limiting their practicality for physical robot deployment. In this work, we
introduce SPARQ, a progress-aware query policy that requests feedback only when
learning stagnates or worsens, thereby reducing unnecessary oracle calls. We
evaluate SPARQ on a simulated UR5 cube-picking task in PyBullet, comparing
against three baselines: no feedback, random querying, and always querying. Our
experiments show that SPARQ achieves near-perfect task success, matching the
performance of always querying while consuming about half the feedback budget.
It also provides more stable and efficient learning than random querying, and
significantly improves over training without feedback. These findings suggest
that selective, progress-based query strategies can make HiL-RL more efficient
and scalable for robots operating under realistic human effort constraints.

Method: 引入GraspFactory数据集，包含Franka Panda和Robotiq 2F-85夹爪的1.09亿个6-DoF抓取，覆盖大量物体。

Result: 在GraspFactory子集上训练的模型在模拟和真实世界环境中都展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraspFactory数据集为训练数据密集型机器人抓取模型提供了重要资源，有助于解决机器人抓取在多样化环境中的泛化问题。

Abstract: Robotic grasping is a crucial task in industrial automation, where robots are
increasingly expected to handle a wide range of objects. However, a significant
challenge arises when robot grasping models trained on limited datasets
encounter novel objects. In real-world environments such as warehouses or
manufacturing plants, the diversity of objects can be vast, and grasping models
need to generalize to this diversity. Training large, generalizable
robot-grasping models requires geometrically diverse datasets. In this paper,
we introduce GraspFactory, a dataset containing over 109 million 6-DoF grasps
collectively for the Franka Panda (with 14,690 objects) and Robotiq 2F-85
grippers (with 33,710 objects). GraspFactory is designed for training
data-intensive models, and we demonstrate the generalization capabilities of
one such model trained on a subset of GraspFactory in both simulated and
real-world settings. The dataset and tools are made available for download at
https://graspfactory.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发全自主环境监测能力，为快速响应海洋污染事件提供技术支持。

Method: 基于ROS系统处理实时传感器数据，更新概率性污染源位置估计，通过信息路径规划技术逐步优化源位置估计并量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在不同源位置、流动条件和起始位置的模拟环境中进行实验，证明该框架能够高精度定位污染源，实现高效可靠的源定位。

Conclusion: 该工作为海洋污染事件的快速响应提供了重要的自主环境监测能力发展贡献。

Abstract: This paper proposes an uncertainty-aware marine pollution source tracking
framework for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). By integrating high-fidelity
marine pollution dispersion simulation with informative path planning
techniques, we demonstrate effective identification of pollution sources in
marine environments. The proposed approach is implemented based on Robot
Operating System (ROS), processing real-time sensor data to update
probabilistic source location estimates. The system progressively refines the
estimation of source location while quantifying uncertainty levels in its
predictions. Experiments conducted in simulated environments with varying
source locations, flow conditions, and starting positions demonstrate the
framework's ability to localise pollution sources with high accuracy. Results
show that the proposed approach achieves reliable source localisation
efficiently. This work contributes to the development of full autonomous
environmental monitoring capabilities essential for rapid response to marine
pollution incidents.

### [9] [Latent Activation Editing: Inference-Time Refinement of Learned Policies for Safer Multirobot Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20623)

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一个推理时潜在激活编辑框架，通过修改预训练策略的中间激活来提升多四旋翼无人机导航的安全性，无需调整模型权重或架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管强化学习在复杂领域取得进展，但训练好的策略在障碍物丰富的环境中仍然容易发生碰撞。重新训练或微调成本高，且可能损害已学技能。

Method: 框架包含两个阶段：在线分类器监测中间激活以检测不良行为状态；激活编辑模块选择性修改被标记的激活，使策略转向更安全的状态。具体通过训练潜在碰撞世界模型来预测未来碰撞前激活。

Result: 在仿真和真实Crazyflie实验中，LAE实现了统计显著的碰撞减少（相比未编辑基线减少近90%累积碰撞），大幅提高了无碰撞轨迹比例，同时保持任务完成能力。

Conclusion: LAE作为一种轻量级范式，可在资源受限硬件上实现学习机器人策略的部署后优化，为安全关键应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has enabled significant progress in complex domains
such as coordinating and navigating multiple quadrotors. However, even
well-trained policies remain vulnerable to collisions in obstacle-rich
environments. Addressing these infrequent but critical safety failures through
retraining or fine-tuning is costly and risks degrading previously learned
skills. Inspired by activation steering in large language models and latent
editing in computer vision, we introduce a framework for inference-time Latent
Activation Editing (LAE) that refines the behavior of pre-trained policies
without modifying their weights or architecture. The framework operates in two
stages: (i) an online classifier monitors intermediate activations to detect
states associated with undesired behaviors, and (ii) an activation editing
module that selectively modifies flagged activations to shift the policy
towards safer regimes. In this work, we focus on improving safety in
multi-quadrotor navigation. We hypothesize that amplifying a policy's internal
perception of risk can induce safer behaviors. We instantiate this idea through
a latent collision world model trained to predict future pre-collision
activations, thereby prompting earlier and more cautious avoidance responses.
Extensive simulations and real-world Crazyflie experiments demonstrate that LAE
achieves statistically significant reduction in collisions (nearly 90% fewer
cumulative collisions compared to the unedited baseline) and substantially
increases the fraction of collision-free trajectories, while preserving task
completion. More broadly, our results establish LAE as a lightweight paradigm,
feasible on resource-constrained hardware, for post-deployment refinement of
learned robot policies.

Abstract: Legged robots must exhibit robust and agile locomotion across diverse,
unstructured terrains, a challenge exacerbated under blind locomotion settings
where terrain information is unavailable. This work introduces a hierarchical
reinforcement learning framework that leverages terrain-specialized policies
and curriculum learning to enhance agility and tracking performance in complex
environments. We validated our method on simulation, where our approach
outperforms a generalist policy by up to 16% in success rate and achieves lower
tracking errors as the velocity target increases, particularly on low-friction
and discontinuous terrains, demonstrating superior adaptability and robustness
across mixed-terrain scenarios.

Abstract: Dexterous in-hand manipulation remains a foundational challenge in robotics,
with progress often constrained by the prevailing paradigm of imitating the
human hand. This anthropomorphic approach creates two critical barriers: 1) it
limits robotic capabilities to tasks humans can already perform, and 2) it
makes data collection for learning-based methods exceedingly difficult. Both
challenges are caused by traditional force-closure which requires coordinating
complex, multi-point contacts based on friction, normal force, and gravity to
grasp an object. This makes teleoperated demonstrations unstable and amplifies
the sim-to-real gap for reinforcement learning. In this work, we propose a
paradigm shift: moving away from replicating human mechanics toward the design
of novel robotic embodiments. We introduce the \textbf{S}uction
\textbf{Leap}-Hand (SLeap Hand), a multi-fingered hand featuring integrated
fingertip suction cups that realize a new form of suction-enabled dexterity. By
replacing complex force-closure grasps with stable, single-point adhesion, our
design fundamentally simplifies in-hand teleoperation and facilitates the
collection of high-quality demonstration data. More importantly, this
suction-based embodiment unlocks a new class of dexterous skills that are
difficult or even impossible for the human hand, such as one-handed paper
cutting and in-hand writing. Our work demonstrates that by moving beyond
anthropomorphic constraints, novel embodiments can not only lower the barrier
for collecting robust manipulation data but also enable the stable,
single-handed completion of tasks that would typically require two human hands.

Abstract: This study introduces a haptic shared control framework designed to teach
human drivers advanced driving skills. In this context, shared control refers
to a driving mode where the human driver collaborates with an autonomous
driving system to control the steering of a vehicle simultaneously. Advanced
driving skills are those necessary to safely push the vehicle to its handling
limits in high-performance driving such as racing and emergency obstacle
avoidance. Previous research has demonstrated the performance and safety
benefits of shared control schemes using both subjective and objective
evaluations. However, these schemes have not been assessed for their impact on
skill acquisition on complex and demanding tasks. Prior research on long-term
skill acquisition either applies haptic shared control to simple tasks or
employs other feedback methods like visual and auditory aids. To bridge this
gap, this study creates a cyber racing coach framework based on the haptic
shared control paradigm and evaluates its performance in helping human drivers
acquire high-performance driving skills. The framework introduces (1) an
autonomous driving system that is capable of cooperating with humans in a
highly performant driving scenario; and (2) a haptic shared control mechanism
along with a fading scheme to gradually reduce the steering assistance from
autonomy based on the human driver's performance during training. Two
benchmarks are considered: self-learning (no assistance) and full assistance
during training. Results from a human subject study indicate that the proposed
framework helps human drivers develop superior racing skills compared to the
benchmarks, resulting in better performance and consistency.

TL;DR: 提出闭环BCI-AR-机器人系统，整合运动想象EEG解码、AR神经反馈和机器人抓取，实现零接触操作，显著提升脑机接口控制的稳定性和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BCI-机器人系统存在EEG信号噪声大、目标选择不灵活、缺乏闭环验证等问题，阻碍了在辅助场景中的实际部署。

Method: 使用14通道EEG耳机进行个性化运动想象校准，智能手机AR界面提供多目标导航和方向一致反馈，机器人手臂结合决策输出和视觉姿态估计进行自主抓取。

Conclusion: AR反馈显著稳定EEG控制，所提框架实现稳健的零接触抓取，推进辅助机器人应用和未来人机交互模式。

Abstract: Reliable brain-computer interface (BCI) control of robots provides an
intuitive and accessible means of human-robot interaction, particularly
valuable for individuals with motor impairments. However, existing BCI-Robot
systems face major limitations: electroencephalography (EEG) signals are noisy
and unstable, target selection is often predefined and inflexible, and most
studies remain restricted to simulation without closed-loop validation. These
issues hinder real-world deployment in assistive scenarios. To address them, we
propose a closed-loop BCI-AR-Robot system that integrates motor imagery
(MI)-based EEG decoding, augmented reality (AR) neurofeedback, and robotic
grasping for zero-touch operation. A 14-channel EEG headset enabled
individualized MI calibration, a smartphone-based AR interface supported
multi-target navigation with direction-congruent feedback to enhance stability,
and the robotic arm combined decision outputs with vision-based pose estimation
for autonomous grasping. Experiments are conducted to validate the framework:
MI training achieved 93.1 percent accuracy with an average information transfer
rate (ITR) of 14.8 bit/min; AR neurofeedback significantly improved sustained
control (SCI = 0.210) and achieved the highest ITR (21.3 bit/min) compared with
static, sham, and no-AR baselines; and closed-loop grasping achieved a 97.2
percent success rate with good efficiency and strong user-reported control.
These results show that AR feedback substantially stabilizes EEG-based control
and that the proposed framework enables robust zero-touch grasping, advancing
assistive robotic applications and future modes of human-robot interaction.

Conclusion: Equi-RO框架通过等变网络和基于图的特征处理，为4D毫米波雷达里程计提供了准确且鲁棒的解决方案，在GPS受限环境中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles and robots rely on accurate odometry estimation in
GPS-denied environments. While LiDARs and cameras struggle under extreme
weather, 4D mmWave radar emerges as a robust alternative with all-weather
operability and velocity measurement. In this paper, we introduce Equi-RO, an
equivariant network-based framework for 4D radar odometry. Our algorithm
pre-processes Doppler velocity into invariant node and edge features in the
graph, and employs separate networks for equivariant and invariant feature
processing. A graph-based architecture enhances feature aggregation in sparse
radar data, improving inter-frame correspondence. Experiments on the
open-source dataset and self-collected dataset show Equi-RO outperforms
state-of-the-art algorithms in accuracy and robustness. Overall, our method
achieves 10.7% and 20.0% relative improvements in translation and rotation
accuracy, respectively, compared to the best baseline on the open-source
dataset.

*Wei-Teng Chu,Tianyi Zhang,Matthew Johnson-Roberson,Weiming Zhi*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FINS是一个轻量级框架，能够基于单张或少量图像快速重建高保真表面和SDF场，通过多分辨率哈希网格编码器和预训练基础模型实现高效训练和几何估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式表面重建方法如NeuS需要大量多视角图像和长时间训练，限制了实际应用。本文旨在开发一个仅需单张图像就能快速重建神经表面的轻量级方法。

Method: 集成多分辨率哈希网格编码器与轻量级几何和颜色头，使用近似二阶优化器进行高效训练；利用预训练基础模型从单张RGB图像估计几何信息。

Result: 在相同条件下，FINS在收敛速度和表面重建、SDF场估计精度方面均优于现有最先进方法，训练时间仅需几秒钟。

Conclusion: FINS展示了在机器人表面跟随任务中的适用性，并在多个基准数据集上具有良好的可扩展性，为单图像隐式表面重建提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit representations have been widely applied in robotics for obstacle
avoidance and path planning. In this paper, we explore the problem of
constructing an implicit distance representation from a single image. Past
methods for implicit surface reconstruction, such as \emph{NeuS} and its
variants generally require a large set of multi-view images as input, and
require long training times. In this work, we propose Fast Image-to-Neural
Surface (FINS), a lightweight framework that can reconstruct high-fidelity
surfaces and SDF fields based on a single or a small set of images. FINS
integrates a multi-resolution hash grid encoder with lightweight geometry and
color heads, making the training via an approximate second-order optimizer
highly efficient and capable of converging within a few seconds. Additionally,
we achieve the construction of a neural surface requiring only a single RGB
image, by leveraging pre-trained foundation models to estimate the geometry
inherent in the image. Our experiments demonstrate that under the same
conditions, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both
convergence speed and accuracy on surface reconstruction and SDF field
estimation. Moreover, we demonstrate the applicability of FINS for robot
surface following tasks and show its scalability to a variety of benchmark
datasets.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RAM-NAS是一种资源感知的多目标神经架构搜索方法，专注于改进超网络预训练和机器人硬件设备的资源感知能力，通过子网相互蒸馏和延迟代理预测器来平衡模型精度和推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经架构搜索方法在训练超网络方面不足，且很少关注实际机器人硬件资源。需要开发资源感知的NAS方法来解决机器人硬件上的模型部署问题。

Method: 提出子网相互蒸馏概念，使用三明治规则采样子网进行相互蒸馏；采用解耦知识蒸馏损失增强logits蒸馏性能；使用三种机器人边缘硬件数据训练延迟代理预测器，在搜索阶段估计硬件推理延迟；采用统一的多目标进化搜索平衡精度和延迟权衡。

Result: RAM-NAS模型在ImageNet上达到76.7%到81.4%的top-1准确率；资源感知多目标NAS显著降低了模型在机器人边缘硬件上的推理延迟；在下游任务中，检测和分割的推理时间相比基于MobileNetv3的方法在所有三种硬件类型上都有所减少。

Conclusion: RAM-NAS填补了NAS在机器人硬件资源感知方面的空白，为机器人应用提供了高效且资源友好的模型架构。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) has shown great promise in automatically
designing lightweight models. However, conventional approaches are insufficient
in training the supernet and pay little attention to actual robot hardware
resources. To meet such challenges, we propose RAM-NAS, a resource-aware
multi-objective NAS method that focuses on improving the supernet pretrain and
resource-awareness on robot hardware devices. We introduce the concept of
subnets mutual distillation, which refers to mutually distilling all subnets
sampled by the sandwich rule. Additionally, we utilize the Decoupled Knowledge
Distillation (DKD) loss to enhance logits distillation performance. To expedite
the search process with consideration for hardware resources, we used data from
three types of robotic edge hardware to train Latency Surrogate predictors.
These predictors facilitated the estimation of hardware inference latency
during the search phase, enabling a unified multi-objective evolutionary search
to balance model accuracy and latency trade-offs. Our discovered model family,
RAM-NAS models, can achieve top-1 accuracy ranging from 76.7% to 81.4% on
ImageNet. In addition, the resource-aware multi-objective NAS we employ
significantly reduces the model's inference latency on edge hardware for
robots. We conducted experiments on downstream tasks to verify the scalability
of our methods. The inference time for detection and segmentation is reduced on
all three hardware types compared to MobileNetv3-based methods. Our work fills
the gap in NAS for robot hardware resource-aware.

Motivation: 扩展现有的点足步行模型，加入踝关节和足部，以更好地模拟人类步行特性并理解其稳定机制。

Method: 设计人类启发的踝关节动力学范式，将基于强制振荡的简化步行模型扩展到包含踝关节和足部的模型。

Result: 与点足模型相比，改进的模型具有更好的步态特性，能够通过足部放置和踝关节策略组合稳定大初始条件误差，且仅通过踝关节方案就能稳定小扰动。

Conclusion: 这种新特性（也见于人类步行）有助于更好地理解拟人化步行及其稳定机制。

Abstract: This paper extends the forced-oscillation-based reduced-order model of
walking to a model with ankles and feet. A human-inspired paradigm was designed
for the ankle dynamics, which results in improved gait characteristics compared
to the point-foot model. In addition, it was shown that while the proposed
model can stabilize against large errors in initial conditions through
combination of foot placement and ankle strategies, the model is able to
stabilize against small perturbations without relying on the foot placement
control and solely through the designed proprioceptive ankle scheme. This novel
property, which is also observed in humans, can help in better understanding of
anthropomorphic walking and its stabilization mechanisms.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RuN是一个解耦的残差学习框架，将人形机器人的运动控制分解为预训练的条件运动生成器和强化学习策略，实现从行走到跑步的自然平滑过渡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度强化学习方法需要单一策略同时学习运动模仿、速度跟踪和稳定性维护，这限制了人形机器人在宽速度范围内的自然动态运动能力。

Method: 引入RuN框架，将控制任务分解：预训练的条件运动生成器提供运动先验，强化学习策略学习轻量级残差修正来处理动力学交互。

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上的仿真和实际实验表明，RuN在0-2.5 m/s速度范围内实现了稳定自然的步态和平滑的行走-跑步转换，在训练效率和最终性能上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: RuN框架通过解耦控制任务，有效解决了人形机器人在宽速度范围内的自然动态运动问题，为机器人运动控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Enabling humanoid robots to achieve natural and dynamic locomotion across a
wide range of speeds, including smooth transitions from walking to running,
presents a significant challenge. Existing deep reinforcement learning methods
typically require the policy to directly track a reference motion, forcing a
single policy to simultaneously learn motion imitation, velocity tracking, and
stability maintenance. To address this, we introduce RuN, a novel decoupled
residual learning framework. RuN decomposes the control task by pairing a
pre-trained Conditional Motion Generator, which provides a kinematically
natural motion prior, with a reinforcement learning policy that learns a
lightweight residual correction to handle dynamical interactions. Experiments
in simulation and reality on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot demonstrate that RuN
achieves stable, natural gaits and smooth walk-run transitions across a broad
velocity range (0-2.5 m/s), outperforming state-of-the-art methods in both
training efficiency and final performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从人类视频演示中学习为机器人操作提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，但由于体现差异和关节可行性约束，直接模仿人类手部动作存在挑战。

Method: 将演示视为物体中心指导，平衡三个目标：选择可行抓取姿态、生成与演示运动一致的物体轨迹、确保在机器人运动学下的无碰撞执行。扩展流匹配到SE(3)空间进行物体轨迹的概率建模。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中验证了该方法在多样化真实世界操作任务中的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的JFTO框架通过统一可微分目标整合抓取相似性、轨迹似然性和碰撞惩罚，实现了密度感知的模仿，避免了模式崩溃问题。

Abstract: Learning from human video demonstrations offers a scalable alternative to
teleoperation or kinesthetic teaching, but poses challenges for robot
manipulators due to embodiment differences and joint feasibility constraints.
We address this problem by proposing the Joint Flow Trajectory Optimization
(JFTO) framework for grasp pose generation and object trajectory imitation
under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties
into a unified differentiable objective. We validate our approach in both
simulation and real-world experiments across diverse real-world manipulation
tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有BIM数据与实时现场条件之间的差距，通过数字孪生技术优先保障施工执行期间的安全。

Method: 开发了Semantic-Gravity ICP点云配准算法，利用LLM推理对象特定方向先验；集成YOLOE目标检测、Shi-Tomasi角点检测和实时手部振动监测。

Result: SG-ICP相比标准ICP在特征遮挡场景中RMSE降低64.3%-88.3%；HAV集成能在超过暴露限值时触发警告，符合ISO 5349-1标准。

Conclusion: BIM2RDT框架成功将静态BIM转化为动态数字孪生，显著提升了施工安全管理和机器人路径优化能力。

Abstract: The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects
design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can
dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This
paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site
Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to
transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready
digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework
bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by
integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM
models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data
collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces
Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that
leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods,
SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors
based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on
local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates
the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE
object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track
construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework
also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping
sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for
intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP,
achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with
occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers
warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在建筑领域，BIM模型包含丰富的环境自然语言描述，需要将自然语言指令与机器人任务规划相结合，实现更安全、上下文感知的路径规划。

Method: 使用Beta-Bernoulli贝叶斯融合方法，将障碍物的设计时排斥系数建模为Beta随机变量，将LLM返回的危险分数作为伪计数来更新参数，生成连续、上下文感知的排斥增益来增强基于欧几里得距离的势场。

Result: 仿真结果表明，该方法在路径鲁棒性和有效性方面都取得了定性和定量的改进。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种数值稳定的方式，可以链接多个自然命令，使机器人能够沿着更安全、更上下文感知的路径进行规划，并具有集成到任何学习或经典AI框架的灵活性。

Abstract: Integrating natural language (NL) prompts into robotic mission planning has
attracted significant interest in recent years. In the construction domain,
Building Information Models (BIM) encapsulate rich NL descriptions of the
environment. We present a novel framework that fuses NL directives with
BIM-derived semantic maps via a Beta-Bernoulli Bayesian fusion by interpreting
the LLM as a sensor: each obstacle's design-time repulsive coefficient is
treated as a Beta(alpha, beta) random variable and LLM-returned danger scores
are incorporated as pseudo-counts to update alpha and beta. The resulting
posterior mean yields a continuous, context-aware repulsive gain that augments
a Euclidean-distance-based potential field for cost heuristics. By adjusting
gains based on sentiment and context inferred from user prompts, our method
guides robots along safer, more context-aware paths. This provides a
numerically stable method that can chain multiple natural commands and prompts
from construction workers and foreman to enable planning while giving
flexibility to be integrated in any learned or classical AI framework.
Simulation results demonstrate that this Beta-Bernoulli fusion yields both
qualitative and quantitative improvements in path robustness and validity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人形机器人的长时间高动态运动跟踪仍然脆弱，因为绝对关节命令无法补偿模型-实际不匹配，导致误差累积。

Method: 使用单阶段强化学习设置，具有统一的观测、奖励和超参数配置，采用端到端管道（训练、仿真到仿真验证、零样本仿真到真实）。

Result: 在Unitree G1上评估重定向的LAFAN1舞蹈序列，并在H1/H1-2上验证迁移，能够跟踪多分钟的高能量行为（跳跃、旋转、侧手翻），并以高运动跟踪质量零样本部署到硬件。

Conclusion: RobotDancing框架能够有效解决人形机器人长时间高动态运动跟踪中的误差累积问题，实现高质量的零样本仿真到真实部署。

Abstract: Long-horizon, high-dynamic motion tracking on humanoids remains brittle
because absolute joint commands cannot compensate model-plant mismatch, leading
to error accumulation. We propose RobotDancing, a simple, scalable framework
that predicts residual joint targets to explicitly correct dynamics
discrepancies. The pipeline is end-to-end--training, sim-to-sim validation, and
zero-shot sim-to-real--and uses a single-stage reinforcement learning (RL)
setup with a unified observation, reward, and hyperparameter configuration. We
evaluate primarily on Unitree G1 with retargeted LAFAN1 dance sequences and
validate transfer on H1/H1-2. RobotDancing can track multi-minute, high-energy
behaviors (jumps, spins, cartwheels) and deploys zero-shot to hardware with
high motion tracking quality.

Conclusion: 这项工作为无SLAM、视觉语言驱动的导航引入了新范式，将机器人探索从几何中心映射转向语义驱动决策。

Abstract: Conventional SLAM pipelines for legged robot navigation are fragile under
rapid motion, calibration demands, and sensor drift, while offering limited
semantic reasoning for task-driven exploration. To deal with these issues, we
propose a vision-only, SLAM-free navigation framework that replaces dense
geometry with semantic reasoning and lightweight topological representations. A
hierarchical vision-language perception module fuses scene-level context with
object-level cues for robust semantic inference. And a semantic-probabilistic
topological map supports coarse-to-fine planning: LLM-based global reasoning
for subgoal selection and vision-based local planning for obstacle avoidance.
Integrated with reinforcement-learning locomotion controllers, the framework is
deployable across diverse legged robot platforms. Experiments in simulation and
real-world settings demonstrate consistent improvements in semantic accuracy,
planning quality, and navigation success, while ablation studies further
showcase the necessity of both hierarchical perception and fine local planning.
This work introduces a new paradigm for SLAM-free, vision-language-driven
navigation, shifting robotic exploration from geometry-centric mapping to
semantics-driven decision making.

Conclusion: MASt3R-Fusion框架成功整合了前馈点云回归与多传感器信息，实现了更准确和鲁棒的视觉SLAM性能，代码将开源发布。

Abstract: Visual SLAM is a cornerstone technique in robotics, autonomous driving and
extended reality (XR), yet classical systems often struggle with low-texture
environments, scale ambiguity, and degraded performance under challenging
visual conditions. Recent advancements in feed-forward neural network-based
pointmap regression have demonstrated the potential to recover high-fidelity 3D
scene geometry directly from images, leveraging learned spatial priors to
overcome limitations of traditional multi-view geometry methods. However, the
widely validated advantages of probabilistic multi-sensor information fusion
are often discarded in these pipelines. In this work, we propose
MASt3R-Fusion,a multi-sensor-assisted visual SLAM framework that tightly
integrates feed-forward pointmap regression with complementary sensor
information, including inertial measurements and GNSS data. The system
introduces Sim(3)-based visualalignment constraints (in the Hessian form) into
a universal metric-scale SE(3) factor graph for effective information fusion. A
hierarchical factor graph design is developed, which allows both real-time
sliding-window optimization and global optimization with aggressive loop
closures, enabling real-time pose tracking, metric-scale structure perception
and globally consistent mapping. We evaluate our approach on both public
benchmarks and self-collected datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements
in accuracy and robustness over existing visual-centered multi-sensor SLAM
systems. The code will be released open-source to support reproducibility and
further research (https://github.com/GREAT-WHU/MASt3R-Fusion).

Abstract: Multi-task reinforcement learning (MTRL) offers a promising approach to
improve sample efficiency and generalization by training agents across multiple
tasks, enabling knowledge sharing between them. However, applying MTRL to
robotics remains challenging due to the high cost of collecting diverse task
data. To address this, we propose MT-L\'evy, a novel exploration strategy that
enhances sample efficiency in MTRL environments by combining behavior sharing
across tasks with temporally extended exploration inspired by L\'evy flight.
MT-L\'evy leverages policies trained on related tasks to guide exploration
towards key states, while dynamically adjusting exploration levels based on
task success ratios. This approach enables more efficient state-space coverage,
even in complex robotics environments. Empirical results demonstrate that
MT-L\'evy significantly improves exploration and sample efficiency, supported
by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation studies further highlight
the contribution of each component, showing that combining behavior sharing
with adaptive exploration strategies can significantly improve the practicality
of MTRL in robotics applications.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单个对象或几何占用地图，缺乏对房间级语义结构的建模能力，需要一种能够预测未知区域语义信息的方法来支持高效导航。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器网络架构，引入掩码约束监督策略，仅在未探索区域应用二进制掩码进行监督，迫使模型从观察到的上下文推断语义结构。

Result: 实验结果表明，SemSight在未探索区域的关键功能类别预测性能上有所提升，在结构一致性和区域识别准确率等指标上优于非掩码监督方法，并在闭环模拟中提高了导航效率。

Conclusion: SemSight通过概率性鸟瞰图预测模型，能够有效推断未知区域的语义结构，为目标驱动导航和自主探索提供了更好的环境理解能力。

Abstract: In target-driven navigation and autonomous exploration, reasonable prediction
of unknown regions is crucial for efficient navigation and environment
understanding. Existing methods mostly focus on single objects or geometric
occupancy maps, lacking the ability to model room-level semantic structures. We
propose SemSight, a probabilistic bird's-eye-view prediction model for
multi-level scene semantics. The model jointly infers structural layouts,
global scene context, and target area distributions, completing semantic maps
of unexplored areas while estimating probability maps for target categories. To
train SemSight, we simulate frontier-driven exploration on 2,000 indoor layout
graphs, constructing a diverse dataset of 40,000 sequential egocentric
observations paired with complete semantic maps. We adopt an encoder-decoder
network as the core architecture and introduce a mask-constrained supervision
strategy. This strategy applies a binary mask of unexplored areas so that
supervision focuses only on unknown regions, forcing the model to infer
semantic structures from the observed context. Experimental results show that
SemSight improves prediction performance for key functional categories in
unexplored regions and outperforms non-mask-supervised approaches on metrics
such as Structural Consistency (SC) and Region Recognition Accuracy (PA). It
also enhances navigation efficiency in closed-loop simulations, reducing the
number of search steps when guiding robots toward target areas.

Conclusion: CoMOK表示方法为端到端机器人操作策略提供了一种通用、精确且可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and
hardware experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在端到端自动驾驶中存在幻觉和泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在分布外场景下可靠性较差，需要提升其在实际部署中的可靠性。

Method: 提出了一个闭环系统，结合基于记忆的经验检索机制和动态工具包，通过记忆-工具协同推理来改善模型的推理和决策能力。

Result: 在NAVSIM基准测试中，3B参数的MTRDrive模型实现了88.3的PDMS分数，驾驶指标得分79.8%，规划准确率82.6%；在Roadwork-VLM基准测试中零样本泛化达到80.2%的驾驶指标得分。

Conclusion: MTRDrive展示了推动自动驾驶向更安全可靠系统发展的潜力，特别是在复杂和未见场景中的鲁棒推理能力。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models(VLMs) have demonstrated significant potential for
end-to-end autonomous driving, yet a substantial gap remains between their
current capabilities and the reliability necessary for real-world deployment. A
critical challenge is their fragility, characterized by hallucinations and poor
generalization in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MTRDrive, a novel framework that integrates procedural driving
experiences with a dynamic toolkit to enhance generalization and proactive
decision-making.
  MTRDrive addresses these limitations through a closed-loop system that
combines a memory-based experience retrieval mechanism with dynamic toolkits.
This synergy enables the model to interact more effectively with its
environment, improving both reasoning and decision-making capabilities with the
help of our memory-tool synergistic reasoning. Additionally, we introduce a new
benchmark based on complex Roadwork construction scenarios to rigorously
evaluate zero-shot generalization.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness of our approach.
On the public NAVSIM benchmark, our 3B-parameter MTRDrive model achieves an
exceptional PDMS of 88.3 without chain-of-thought and sets a state-of-the-art
performance bar on high-level planning, with a driving metric score of 79.8\%
and a planning accuracy of 82.6\%. Rigorous zero-shot evaluation on the new
Roadwork-VLM benchmark shows a strong ability to reason robustly in unseen
scenarios, achieving a driving metric score of 80.2\%. These results highlight
MTRDrive's potential to advance autonomous driving toward safer and more
reliable systems.

*Xiaohan Ye,Kui Wu,Zherong Pan,Taku Komura*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文针对可微分物理模拟中梯度信息不稳定的问题，提出了一套接触模型设计准则，并开发了一个满足所有准则的实用接触模型，显著提升了梯度优化在接触密集型任务中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可微分物理的成熟，其在模型预测控制、机器人设计优化等下游应用中的作用日益重要。但可微分模拟器提供的梯度信息经常出现突变或消失，阻碍了基于梯度的优化器收敛。

Method: 作者发现梯度异常行为与接触模型设计密切相关，提出了一套确保梯度行为良好的接触模型必须满足的性质，并开发了一个满足所有这些性质且计算高效的实际接触模型。

Result: 实验表明，即使从简单初始化开始，该接触模型也能发现复杂的接触密集型控制信号，成功执行各种下游运动和操作任务。

Conclusion: 通过设计满足特定性质的接触模型，可以有效解决可微分物理模拟中的梯度不稳定问题，为接触密集型任务提供可靠的梯度优化支持。

Abstract: With the maturation of differentiable physics, its role in various downstream
applications: such as model predictive control, robotic design optimization,
and neural PDE solvers, has become increasingly important. However, the
derivative information provided by differentiable simulators can exhibit abrupt
changes or vanish altogether, impeding the convergence of gradient-based
optimizers. In this work, we demonstrate that such erratic gradient behavior is
closely tied to the design of contact models. We further introduce a set of
properties that a contact model must satisfy to ensure well-behaved gradient
information. Lastly, we present a practical contact model for differentiable
rigid-body simulators that satisfies all of these properties while maintaining
computational efficiency. Our experiments show that, even from simple
initializations, our contact model can discover complex, contact-rich control
signals, enabling the successful execution of a range of downstream locomotion
and manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: 提出TISA模块解决自动驾驶规划中的时空错位问题，通过DPO优化实现最先进的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在自动驾驶端到端规划中表现出色，但受限于时空错位问题，即规划器必须基于过去的感知数据来预测未来动作，这造成了世界观不一致，限制了性能上限

Method: 1. 提出时间不变空间对齐(TISA)模块，将初始环境特征投影到每个未来时间步的一致自我中心坐标系；2. 使用运动学动作预测头确保物理可行的轨迹；3. 引入基于直接偏好优化(DPO)的多目标后训练阶段，提供针对特定驾驶行为的精细反馈

Result: 在NAVSIM数据集上实现了89.8 PDMS的最先进性能，在自回归模型中表现最佳

Conclusion: 通过TISA模块解决时空错位问题，结合DPO优化，显著提升了自动驾驶端到端规划的性能

Abstract: The inherent sequential modeling capabilities of autoregressive models make
them a formidable baseline for end-to-end planning in autonomous driving.
Nevertheless, their performance is constrained by a spatio-temporal
misalignment, as the planner must condition future actions on past sensory
data. This creates an inconsistent worldview, limiting the upper bound of
performance for an otherwise powerful approach. To address this, we propose a
Time-Invariant Spatial Alignment (TISA) module that learns to project initial
environmental features into a consistent ego-centric frame for each future time
step, effectively correcting the agent's worldview without explicit future
scene prediction. In addition, we employ a kinematic action prediction head
(i.e., acceleration and yaw rate) to ensure physically feasible trajectories.
Finally, we introduce a multi-objective post-training stage using Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO) to move beyond pure imitation. Our approach
provides targeted feedback on specific driving behaviors, offering a more
fine-grained learning signal than the single, overall objective used in
standard DPO. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 89.8 PDMS on the NAVSIM
dataset among autoregressive models. The video document is available at

Abstract: We address natural language pick-and-place in unseen, unpredictable indoor
environments with AnywhereVLA, a modular framework for mobile manipulation. A
user text prompt serves as an entry point and is parsed into a structured task
graph that conditions classical SLAM with LiDAR and cameras, metric semantic
mapping, and a task-aware frontier exploration policy. An approach planner then
selects visibility and reachability aware pre grasp base poses. For
interaction, a compact SmolVLA manipulation head is fine tuned on platform pick
and place trajectories for the SO-101 by TheRobotStudio, grounding local visual
context and sub-goals into grasp and place proposals. The full system runs
fully onboard on consumer-level hardware, with Jetson Orin NX for perception
and VLA and an Intel NUC for SLAM, exploration, and control, sustaining
real-time operation. We evaluated AnywhereVLA in a multi-room lab under static
scenes and normal human motion. In this setting, the system achieves a $46\%$
overall task success rate while maintaining throughput on embedded compute. By
combining a classical stack with a fine-tuned VLA manipulation, the system
inherits the reliability of geometry-based navigation with the agility and task
generalization of language-conditioned manipulation.

Conclusion: 该方法在非结构化动态环境中显著提升了多机器人EV电池拆卸的自主性、精度和安全性。

Abstract: Electric-vehicle (EV) battery disassembly requires precise multi-robot
coordination, short and reliable motions, and robust collision safety in
cluttered, dynamic scenes. We propose a four-layer task-and-motion planning
(TAMP) framework that couples symbolic task planning and cost- and
accessibility-aware allocation with a TP-GMM-guided motion planner learned from
demonstrations. Stereo vision with YOLOv8 provides real-time component
localization, while OctoMap-based 3D mapping and FCL(Flexible Collision
Library) checks in MoveIt unify predictive digital-twin collision checking with
reactive, vision-based avoidance. Validated on two UR10e robots across cable,
busbar, service plug, and three leaf-cell removals, the approach yields
substantially more compact and safer motions than a default RRTConnect baseline
under identical perception and task assignments: average end-effector path
length drops by $-63.3\%$ and makespan by $-8.1\%$; per-arm swept volumes
shrink (R1: $0.583\rightarrow0.139\,\mathrm{m}^3$; R2:
$0.696\rightarrow0.252\,\mathrm{m}^3$), and mutual overlap decreases by $47\%$

TL;DR: KeyWorld框架通过专注于语义关键帧来改进文本条件机器人世界模型，实现了5.68倍加速，同时提高了生成视频的物理有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人世界模型的推理速度和生成轨迹的物理合理性是限制其实际应用的关键瓶颈，主要源于帧到帧生成方法的冗余计算和对关键转换语义重要性的忽视。

Method: KeyWorld首先通过迭代简化机器人运动轨迹识别重要转换，获取真实关键帧；然后训练DiT模型从文本任务描述中推理生成这些物理有意义的关键帧；最后使用轻量级插值器高效重建完整视频。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，KeyWorld相比帧到帧生成基线实现了5.68倍加速，专注于运动感知关键帧进一步提高了生成视频的物理有效性，特别是在复杂任务上。

Conclusion: 该方法为在实时机器人控制和其他需要高效有效世界模型的领域中部署世界模型提供了一条实用路径。

Abstract: Robotic world models are a promising paradigm for forecasting future
environment states, yet their inference speed and the physical plausibility of
generated trajectories remain critical bottlenecks, limiting their real-world
applications. This stems from the redundancy of the prevailing frame-to-frame
generation approach, where the model conducts costly computation on similar
frames, as well as neglecting the semantic importance of key transitions. To
address this inefficiency, we propose KeyWorld, a framework that improves
text-conditioned robotic world models by concentrating transformers computation
on a few semantic key frames while employing a lightweight convolutional model
to fill the intermediate frames. Specifically, KeyWorld first identifies
significant transitions by iteratively simplifying the robot's motion
trajectories, obtaining the ground truth key frames. Then, a DiT model is
trained to reason and generate these physically meaningful key frames from
textual task descriptions. Finally, a lightweight interpolator efficiently
reconstructs the full video by inpainting all intermediate frames. Evaluations
on the LIBERO benchmark demonstrate that KeyWorld achieves a 5.68$\times$
acceleration compared to the frame-to-frame generation baseline, and focusing
on the motion-aware key frames further contributes to the physical validity of
the generated videos, especially on complex tasks. Our approach highlights a
practical path toward deploying world models in real-time robotic control and
other domains requiring both efficient and effective world models. Code is

Abstract: This paper presents an integrated Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Model
Predictive Control (MPC) framework for autonomous satellite docking with a
partially filled fuel tank. Traditional docking control faces challenges due to
fuel sloshing in microgravity, which induces unpredictable forces affecting
stability. To address this, we integrate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and
Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) RL algorithms with MPC, leveraging MPC's predictive
capabilities to accelerate RL training and improve control robustness. The
proposed approach is validated through Zero-G Lab of SnT experiments for planar
stabilization and high-fidelity numerical simulations for 6-DOF docking with
fuel sloshing dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that SAC-MPC achieves
superior docking accuracy, higher success rates, and lower control effort,
outperforming standalone RL and PPO-MPC methods. This study advances
fuel-efficient and disturbance-resilient satellite docking, enhancing the
feasibility of on-orbit refueling and servicing missions.

Abstract: The field of general purpose robotics has recently embraced powerful
probabilistic models, such as diffusion models, to model and learn complex
behaviors. However, these models often come with significant trade-offs, namely
high computational costs for inference and a fundamental inability to quantify
output uncertainty. We argue that a model's trustworthiness, a critical factor
for reliable, general-purpose robotics, is inherently linked to its ability to
provide confidence measures.
  In this work, we introduce Normalizing Flows Policy, a novel visuomotor
policy learning model based on Normalizing Flows. We show that Normalizing
Flows are a natural and powerful alternative to diffusion models, providing
both a statistically sound measure of confidence and a highly efficient
inference process. Through comprehensive experiments across four distinct
simulated robotic tasks, we demonstrate that Normalizing Flows Policy achieves
performance comparable to, and often surpassing, Diffusion Policy, and it does
so not only with improved sample efficiency but also with up to 30 times faster
inference. Additionally, our ablation study validates several key architectural
and training techniques that enable Normalizing Flows to perform well in this
domain.

Abstract: Drone-based rapid and accurate environmental edge detection is highly
advantageous for tasks such as disaster relief and autonomous navigation.
Current methods, using radars or cameras, raise deployment costs and burden
lightweight drones with high computational demands. In this paper, we propose
AirTouch, a system that transforms the ground effect from a stability "foe" in
traditional flight control views, into a "friend" for accurate and efficient
edge detection. Our key insight is that analyzing drone basic attitude sensor
readings and flight commands allows us to detect ground effect changes. Such
changes typically indicate the drone flying over a boundary of two materials,
making this information valuable for edge detection. We approach this insight
through theoretical analysis, algorithm design, and implementation, fully
leveraging the ground effect as a new sensing modality without compromising
drone flight stability, thereby achieving accurate and efficient scene edge
detection. We also compare this new sensing modality with vision-based methods
to clarify its exclusive advantages in resource efficiency and detection
capability. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a high
detection accuracy with mean detection distance errors of 0.051m, outperforming
the baseline method performance by 86%. With such detection performance, our
system requires only 43 mW power consumption, contributing to this new sensing
modality for low-cost and highly efficient edge detection.

Abstract: Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: 强化学习的优势不在于改进的参数调谐或非线性映射能力，而在于有效利用更全面的状态观测，强调了状态表示在学习型系统中的关键作用。

Abstract: This paper addresses a drone ball-balancing task, in which a drone stabilizes
a ball atop a movable beam through cable-based interaction. We propose a
hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from
low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to
handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL
policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID
controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic
comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from
improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from
its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings
underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in
learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental
in improving controller performance.

Abstract: Multimodal agents have demonstrated strong performance in general GUI
interactions, but their application in automotive systems has been largely
unexplored. In-vehicle GUIs present distinct challenges: drivers' limited
attention, strict safety requirements, and complex location-based interaction
patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce Automotive-ENV, the first
high-fidelity benchmark and interaction environment tailored for vehicle GUIs.
This platform defines 185 parameterized tasks spanning explicit control,
implicit intent understanding, and safety-aware tasks, and provides structured
multimodal observations with precise programmatic checks for reproducible
evaluation. Building on this benchmark, we propose ASURADA, a geo-aware
multimodal agent that integrates GPS-informed context to dynamically adjust
actions based on location, environmental conditions, and regional driving
norms. Experiments show that geo-aware information significantly improves
success on safety-aware tasks, highlighting the importance of location-based
context in automotive environments. We will release Automotive-ENV, complete
with all tasks and benchmarking tools, to further the development of safe and
adaptive in-vehicle agents.

Conclusion: DAGDiff能够直接在真实世界点云上为未见物体生成双臂抓取，并在异构双臂设置上可靠执行抓取和提升操作。

Abstract: Reliable dual-arm grasping is essential for manipulating large and complex
objects but remains a challenging problem due to stability, collision, and
generalization requirements. Prior methods typically decompose the task into
two independent grasp proposals, relying on region priors or heuristics that
limit generalization and provide no principled guarantee of stability. We
propose DAGDiff, an end-to-end framework that directly denoises to grasp pairs
in the SE(3) x SE(3) space. Our key insight is that stability and collision can
be enforced more effectively by guiding the diffusion process with classifier
signals, rather than relying on explicit region detection or object priors. To
this end, DAGDiff integrates geometry-, stability-, and collision-aware
guidance terms that steer the generative process toward grasps that are
physically valid and force-closure compliant. We comprehensively evaluate
DAGDiff through analytical force-closure checks, collision analysis, and
large-scale physics-based simulations, showing consistent improvements over
previous work on these metrics. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework
generates dual-arm grasps directly on real-world point clouds of previously
unseen objects, which are executed on a heterogeneous dual-arm setup where two
manipulators reliably grasp and lift them.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人导航系统缺乏人类导航行为（如阅读标志、询问方向），导致在大型环境中导航效率低下。

Method: 基于导航地标设计紧凑的输入输出抽象，利用视觉语言模型的语言理解和推理能力，集成人类式导航技能。

Result: 在真实和模拟导航任务中评估显示，智能体成功运用高阶推理在大型复杂建筑中高效导航。

Conclusion: ReasonNav系统通过集成人类式导航技能，显著提升了机器人在大型环境中的导航效率。

Abstract: When navigating in a man-made environment they haven't visited before--like
an office building--humans employ behaviors such as reading signs and asking
others for directions. These behaviors help humans reach their destinations
efficiently by reducing the need to search through large areas. Existing robot
navigation systems lack the ability to execute such behaviors and are thus
highly inefficient at navigating within large environments. We present
ReasonNav, a modular navigation system which integrates these human-like
navigation skills by leveraging the reasoning capabilities of a vision-language
model (VLM). We design compact input and output abstractions based on
navigation landmarks, allowing the VLM to focus on language understanding and
reasoning. We evaluate ReasonNav on real and simulated navigation tasks and
show that the agent successfully employs higher-order reasoning to navigate
efficiently in large, complex buildings.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了几种新型多旋翼无人机配置，通过增加螺旋桨轴角度控制输入来实现全向姿态控制，解决了传统多旋翼欠驱动系统的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多旋翼无人机是欠驱动系统，无法独立控制姿态和位置，这限制了其飞行性能。本研究旨在解决这一限制，开发能够独立控制姿态的全向无人机系统。

Method: 提出了多种配置方案，增加螺旋桨轴角度控制输入；建立了详细动力学模型并通过Simscape Multibody仿真验证；设计了滑模控制器和新型PID控制器；开发了定制控制分配策略来管理系统输入非仿射特性。

Result: 控制器能够有效处理剧烈扰动和不确定性；通过仿真比较了不同配置和控制器的功耗表现；进行了定性比较以评估不同类型不确定性对控制系统的影响。

Conclusion: 该研究为未来研究人员设计全向无人机提供了路线图，提供了配置选择和控制器设计的实用见解，有助于根据设计目标优化无人机性能。

Abstract: Conventional multi-rotors are under-actuated systems, hindering them from
independently controlling attitude from position. In this study, we present
several distinct configurations that incorporate additional control inputs for
manipulating the angles of the propeller axes. This addresses the mentioned
limitations, making the systems "omniorientational". We comprehensively derived
detailed dynamic models for all introduced configurations and validated by a
methodology using Simscape Multibody simulations. Two controllers are designed:
a sliding mode controller for robust handling of disturbances and a novel
PID-based controller with gravity compensation integrating linear and
non-linear allocators, designed for computational efficiency. A custom control
allocation strategy is implemented to manage the input-non-affine nature of
these systems, seeking to maximize battery life by minimizing the "Power
Consumption Factor" defined in this study. Moreover, the controllers
effectively managed harsh disturbances and uncertainties. Simulations compare
and analyze the proposed configurations and controllers, majorly considering
their power consumption. Furthermore, we conduct a qualitative comparison to
evaluate the impact of different types of uncertainties on the control system,
highlighting areas for potential model or hardware improvements. The analysis
in this study provides a roadmap for future researchers to design
omniorientational drones based on their design objectives, offering practical
insights into configuration selection and controller design. This research
aligns with the project SAC-1, one of the objectives of Sharif AgRoLab.

TL;DR: 提出SEEC框架，通过模型增强的残差学习和扰动生成器，实现人形机器人末端执行器的精确稳定控制，能够适应未见过的运动控制器而无需重新训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人臂端稳定控制的挑战，传统模型方法依赖精确动力学建模难以处理现实因素，而学习方法容易过拟合且难以适应新场景。

Method: 采用模型增强的残差学习框架，结合模型引导的强化学习和扰动生成器，学习对下半身引起的扰动进行精确鲁棒的末端执行器补偿。

Result: 在不同模拟器中验证，并将训练策略转移到Booster T1人形机器人，实验表明方法优于基线，能鲁棒处理各种要求高的移动操作任务。

Conclusion: SEEC框架实现了精确鲁棒的末端执行器稳定控制，能够适应未见过的运动控制器，在人形机器人移动操作任务中表现优异。

Abstract: Arm end-effector stabilization is essential for humanoid loco-manipulation
tasks, yet it remains challenging due to the high degrees of freedom and
inherent dynamic instability of bipedal robot structures. Previous model-based
controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics
modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors
(e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand,
learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and
domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they
often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire
body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework
with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust
end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through
model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This
design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector
stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no
additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and
transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments
demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly
handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.

TL;DR: FSGlove是一个惯性运动捕捉系统，能同时跟踪48个自由度并重建个性化手部形状，通过DiffHCal校准方法实现高精度手部运动捕捉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有商业手套最多只能提供21个自由度，无法捕捉复杂的手部操作，同时忽略了对手部接触任务至关重要的形状变化。

Method: 每个手指关节和手背配备IMU传感器，结合DiffHCal校准方法，通过可微分优化与参数化MANO模型集成，在一次流线型校准中解决关节运动学、形状参数和传感器错位问题。

Result: 系统达到最先进的精度，关节角度误差小于2.7度，在形状重建和接触保真度方面优于商业替代方案，能够捕捉细微动作如指尖摩擦。

Conclusion: FSGlove通过统一运动学和接触保真度推进了手部跟踪技术，其开源硬件和软件设计确保与当前VR和机器人生态系统的兼容性。

Abstract: Accurate hand motion capture (MoCap) is vital for applications in robotics,
virtual reality, and biomechanics, yet existing systems face limitations in
capturing high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) joint kinematics and personalized hand
shape. Commercial gloves offer up to 21 DoFs, which are insufficient for
complex manipulations while neglecting shape variations that are critical for
contact-rich tasks. We present FSGlove, an inertial-based system that
simultaneously tracks up to 48 DoFs and reconstructs personalized hand shapes
via DiffHCal, a novel calibration method. Each finger joint and the dorsum are
equipped with IMUs, enabling high-resolution motion sensing. DiffHCal
integrates with the parametric MANO model through differentiable optimization,
resolving joint kinematics, shape parameters, and sensor misalignment during a
single streamlined calibration. The system achieves state-of-the-art accuracy,
with joint angle errors of less than 2.7 degree, and outperforms commercial
alternatives in shape reconstruction and contact fidelity. FSGlove's
open-source hardware and software design ensures compatibility with current VR
and robotics ecosystems, while its ability to capture subtle motions (e.g.,
fingertip rubbing) bridges the gap between human dexterity and robotic
imitation. Evaluated against Nokov optical MoCap, FSGlove advances hand
tracking by unifying the kinematic and contact fidelity. Hardware design,

TL;DR: RetoVLA是一种轻量级视觉-语言-动作模型，通过重用Vision Transformer中的Register Tokens来增强空间推理能力，在保持轻量化的同时显著提升机器人操作任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VLA模型虽然泛化能力强，但体积庞大、计算成本高，限制了实际部署。传统的轻量化方法往往牺牲关键能力特别是空间推理，需要在效率和性能之间权衡。

Method: 提出RetoVA架构，重用Vision Transformer中原本被丢弃的Register Tokens，将这些包含重要空间信息的tokens直接注入到Action Expert中。

Result: 在7-DOF机器人手臂上的实验显示，复杂操作任务的成功率绝对提升了17.1个百分点，证明了重用Register Tokens能有效增强空间推理。

Conclusion: 被丢弃的Register Tokens实际上是机器人智能中有价值的未开发资源，重用这些tokens可以在保持轻量化的同时显著提升空间推理能力。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models demonstrate remarkable
generalization in robotics but are restricted by their substantial size and
computational cost, limiting real-world deployment. However, conventional
lightweighting methods often sacrifice critical capabilities, particularly
spatial reasoning. This creates a trade-off between efficiency and performance.
To address this challenge, our work reuses Register Tokens, which were
introduced for artifact removal in Vision Transformers but subsequently
discarded. We suppose that these tokens contain essential spatial information
and propose RetoVLA, a novel architecture that reuses them directly by
injecting them into the Action Expert.
  RetoVLA maintains a lightweight structure while leveraging this repurposed
spatial context to enhance reasoning. We demonstrate RetoVLA's effectiveness
through a series of comprehensive experiments. On our custom-built 7-DOF robot
arm, the model achieves a 17.1%p absolute improvement in success rates for
complex manipulation tasks. Our results confirm that reusing Register Tokens
directly enhances spatial reasoning, demonstrating that what was previously
discarded as an artifact is in fact a valuable, unexplored resource for robotic
intelligence. A video demonstration is available at:

Conclusion: BiNoMaP为双非抓取操作提供了通用解决方案，突破了传统方法的限制，展示了强大的泛化性能。

Abstract: Non-prehensile manipulation, encompassing ungraspable actions such as
pushing, poking, and pivoting, represents a critical yet underexplored domain
in robotics due to its contact-rich and analytically intractable nature. In
this work, we revisit this problem from two novel perspectives. First, we move
beyond the usual single-arm setup and the strong assumption of favorable
external dexterity such as walls, ramps, or edges. Instead, we advocate a
generalizable dual-arm configuration and establish a suite of Bimanual
Non-prehensile Manipulation Primitives (BiNoMaP). Second, we depart from the
prevailing RL-based paradigm and propose a three-stage, RL-free framework to
learn non-prehensile skills. Specifically, we begin by extracting bimanual hand
motion trajectories from video demonstrations. Due to visual inaccuracies and
morphological gaps, these coarse trajectories are difficult to transfer
directly to robotic end-effectors. To address this, we propose a geometry-aware
post-optimization algorithm that refines raw motions into executable
manipulation primitives that conform to specific motion patterns. Beyond
instance-level reproduction, we further enable category-level generalization by
parameterizing the learned primitives with object-relevant geometric
attributes, particularly size, resulting in adaptable and general parameterized
manipulation primitives. We validate BiNoMaP across a range of representative
bimanual tasks and diverse object categories, demonstrating its effectiveness,
efficiency, versatility, and superior generalization capability.

Conclusion: GMP³框架成功解决了无人机在复杂3D环境中的动态轨迹规划问题，通过分布式协同机制实现了全局优化的路径生成，为实际部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: We propose $\text{GMP}^{3}$, a multiphase global path planning framework that
generates dynamically feasible three-dimensional trajectories for unmanned
aerial vehicles (UAVs) operating in cluttered environments. The framework
extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie
group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and
rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support
reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory
information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a
distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy
information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and
shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative
policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under
kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control
software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink
protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and
indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in
constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and
smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation. The
open-source implementation is available at

Conclusion: GPHDM成功地将运动层次结构与时间动态相结合，为机器人运动生成提供了既符合分类结构又保持物理一致性的新方法。

Abstract: Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.
