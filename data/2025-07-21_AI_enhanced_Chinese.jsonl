Under review at ASME Journal of Mechanical\n  Design", "summary": "Compliant mechanisms have significant potential in precision applications due\nto their ability to guide motion without contact. However, an inherent\nvulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of\ncompliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly\nchallenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and\nthe cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical\nto prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on\nstacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to\nguarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a\nsystematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in\ncompliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a\nsingle pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a\ntheoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry\nto maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that\nthe mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method\nto a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and\nprovide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers\nreliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling.

However, the ability of these\nalgorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space\nbecomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the\nsolution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more\ncomplex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine\nOptimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine\nTransform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input\nmatrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce\nthe dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of\nthe original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using\nSCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a\nmatrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are\nthen transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the\naddition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.\nSCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series\npose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of\ncompressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension\nis no greater than the corresponding input dimension.

To demonstrate\neffectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five\nexperimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square\nerrors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was\nperformed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u6cbb\u7597\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u767d\u5185\u969c\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5149\u5b66\u76f8\u5e72\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u63a2\u5934\u5b9e\u73b0\u56ca\u819c\u6e05\u6d01\u624b\u672f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u624b\u672f\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ee7\u53d1\u6027\u767d\u5185\u969c\u662f\u767d\u5185\u969c\u624b\u672f\u540e\u5e38\u89c1\u7684\u5e76\u53d1\u75c7\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u624b\u672f\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6e05\u6d01\u56ca\u819c\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u5149\u5b66\u76f8\u5e72\u65ad\u5c42\u626b\u63cf\u63a2\u5934\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u65f6\u56ca\u819c\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u5de5\u5177-\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8ddd\u79bb\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u773c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u56ca\u819c\u6620\u5c04\u7b56\u7565\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u5747\u65b9\u6839\u8bef\u5dee\uff1b\u5728\u79bb\u4f53\u732a\u773c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u6e05\u6d01\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u9020\u6210\u7ec4\u7ec7\u635f\u4f24\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u9ad8\u56ca\u819c\u6e05\u6d01\u624b\u672f\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u6cbb\u7597\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

The proposed method\naddresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory\ntracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the\nrepetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the\nframework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion\nscenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based\nmodel derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time\nlearning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A\ncentral contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned\ncontrol profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and\ngravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and\nsignificantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the\nbipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations\nand hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework\nreduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables\nreliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope\ntraversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body\ncontrollers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation\nduring execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of\nexisting methods.

Relying solely on real-world driving\nscenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While\nautomatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models\nrequire extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the\noutput. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a\ndistributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the\nvalidity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners.

A recent study has shown how self-aggregation\nis possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task\ninstances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach\nposes new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the\nperformance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of\nrobots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully\ncompact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask\nself-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into\ndifferent compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor.

Most robotic systems today treat their\nphysical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing\nthe same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly\ndifferent computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a\nnovel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives\nthat balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing\napproaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or\ninflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic\ngradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides\nexplicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff.\nQuantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline\napproaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis\nApproximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation\nwith fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show\nenhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich\ninteraction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces.
