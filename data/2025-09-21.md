TL;DR: AEGIS是一个自动化错误生成和识别框架，通过向成功的多智能体系统轨迹中注入可控错误来创建大规模错误数据集，支持监督微调、强化学习和对比学习三种范式，显著提升了错误识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统日益复杂自主，但缺乏大规模、多样化的错误标注数据集，严重阻碍了系统可靠性和安全性研究。

Method: 使用基于LLM的上下文感知自适应操纵器，通过提示注入和响应破坏等复杂攻击方式，在成功轨迹中系统性地注入可控、可追踪的错误。

Result: 在三种学习范式上都实现了显著性能提升，多个微调模型性能达到或超过大一个数量级的专有系统。

Conclusion: AEGIS自动化数据生成框架是开发更鲁棒、可解释多智能体系统的关键资源，验证了自动化错误生成方法的有效性。

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过引入物理可解释的能量流场（风险势场和车道吸引场）来编码语义先验和安全线索，提升运动规划的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架依赖隐式学习的BEV特征，缺乏对风险和引导先验的显式建模，无法保证安全且可解释的规划。

Method: 提出FlowDrive框架：1）引入风险势场和车道吸引场等物理可解释流场；2）使用条件扩散规划器分离运动意图预测和轨迹去噪；3）通过特征级门控增强多模态多样性。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2基准测试中达到86.3的EPDMS分数，在安全性和规划质量方面均超越现有基线方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过显式建模语义先验和安全线索，实现了更安全、可解释且性能优越的自动驾驶运动规划。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is
available at https://astrixdrive.github.io/FlowDrive.github.io/.

### [3] [Multi-Quadruped Cooperative Object Transport: Learning Decentralized Pinch-Lift-Move](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14342)
*Bikram Pandit,Aayam Kumar Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 多足机器人团队通过纯接触力协调，无需机械耦合或通信，实现无抓取物体的去中心化协同运输


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机械独立的机器人仅通过接触力进行协调的挑战性场景，无需依赖刚性机械耦合或集中控制

Method: 采用分层策略架构分离基座移动和手臂控制，提出星座奖励公式统一位置和方向跟踪以强制执行刚性接触行为

Result: 在2-10个机器人规模上展示了跨不同物体几何形状和质量的鲁棒运输，并实现了轻量级物体的仿真到现实迁移

Conclusion: 通过精心设计的奖励和训练课程，使机器人表现得如同与物体刚性连接，实现了无需重新训练即可扩展到任意团队规模的协调能力

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

*Zhengyang Kris Weng,Matthew L. Elwin,Han Liu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LeVR是一个模块化软件框架，通过VR遥操作解决机器人模仿学习中数据收集的难题，并与LeRobot框架原生集成，提供从数据收集到策略部署的端到端工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人模仿学习中两个关键问题：1）为配备灵巧手的机械臂提供强大直观的VR遥操作数据收集；2）与现有模仿学习框架的集成不足。

Method: 开发LeVR模块化框架，提供VR遥操作接口，与LeRobot模仿学习框架原生集成，并发布LeFranX开源实现（针对Franka FER臂和RobotEra XHand）。

Result: 成功收集了100个专家演示的公开数据集，并用其微调了最先进的视觉运动策略，验证了系统的有效性。

Conclusion: LeVR框架有效解决了机器人模仿学习中的数据收集和集成问题，通过开源框架、实现和数据集加速机器人社区的模仿学习研究。

Abstract: We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two
critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and
intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot
arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing
systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation
learning (IL) framework, enabling the use of VR-based teleoperation data and
streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we
release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and
RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a
seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy
deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert
demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor
policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to
accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamControl结合扩散模型和强化学习，利用人类运动数据的扩散先验指导RL策略，实现人形机器人自主全身技能学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人同时控制上下半身和物体交互的复杂任务，通过人类运动先验提升RL效果和动作自然度

Method: 使用人类运动数据训练扩散先验模型，在仿真中指导RL策略学习特定任务

Result: 证明该方法能发现直接RL无法获得的解决方案，扩散模型促进动作自然性，有助于仿真到现实的迁移

Conclusion: DreamControl在Unitree G1机器人上验证了其在多样化挑战任务中的有效性

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous
whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion
models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower
and upper body control and object interaction.

### [6] [CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380)
*Seoyeon Choi,Kanghyun Ryu,Jonghoon Ock,Negar Mehr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个利用基础模型作为"教练"的多机器人协调框架，通过LLM自动分解长时程任务为子任务序列，并使用VLM指导奖励函数优化，在四足机器人导航和双手操作任务中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类通过分阶段课程学习复杂协调行为的启发，解决MARL在机器人应用中面临的高维连续动作空间、复杂奖励设计和非平稳转换等挑战

Method: 使用LLM的规划能力自动分解长时程协调任务为子任务序列，通过LLM生成奖励函数训练每个子任务，并采用VLM指导的奖励优化循环进行精炼

Result: 在多四足机器人导航和双手操作任务中成功学习到复杂协调行为，并在真实硬件实验中验证了多四足机器人导航策略的有效性

Conclusion: CRAFT框架通过利用基础模型的推理能力，为多机器人协调任务提供了有效的自主教练机制，能够处理复杂的长期协调学习问题

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

### [7] [RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14383)
*Yuhong Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RLBind是一个两阶段对抗不变性跨模态对齐框架，通过无监督微调硬化视觉编码器，并利用跨模态对应关系最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异，在保持泛化能力的同时显著提升多模态编码器的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 统一多模态编码器在机器人感知中很重要，但面临对抗性和自然损坏的威胁，现有防御方法通常只关注CLIP风格编码器内的特征对齐而忽视了更广泛的跨模态对应关系，导致鲁棒性提升有限且可能损害零样本迁移能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段对干净-对抗样本对进行无监督微调来硬化视觉编码器；第二阶段利用跨模态对应关系，最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异，同时强制跨模态的类间分布对齐。

Result: 在图像、音频、热成像和视频数据上的广泛实验表明，RLBind在干净准确率和有界对抗鲁棒性方面均 consistently优于LanguageBind主干和标准微调基线。

Conclusion: RLBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高了鲁棒性，为具身机器人在导航、操作和其他自主场景中提供了更安全的多传感器感知堆栈的实用路径。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

### [8] [GestOS: Advanced Hand Gesture Interpretation via Large Language Models to control Any Type of Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14412)
*Artem Lykov,Oleg Kobzarev,Dzmitry Tsetserukou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GestOS是一个基于手势的操作系统，通过语义理解和LLM推理实现多机器人团队的智能任务分配与控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手势控制系统通常将手势映射为固定命令或单机器人动作，缺乏对多机器人团队的语义理解和动态任务分配能力

Method: 结合轻量级视觉感知和大型语言模型推理：将手势转换为结构化文本描述，LLM推断意图并生成机器人特定命令，实时匹配最适合的机器人执行任务

Result: 实现了上下文感知的自适应控制，无需用户明确指定目标或命令，支持动态环境中可扩展、灵活的用户友好型机器人协作

Conclusion: GestOS将手势交互从识别提升到智能编排层面，为异构机器人团队提供了语义化、动态分布式的控制解决方案

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

### [9] [Perception-Integrated Safety Critical Control via Analytic Collision Cone Barrier Functions on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14421)
*Dario Tscholl,Yashwanth Nakka,Brian Gunter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于3D高斯拷贝的碰撞键形成了闭式前向碰撞凸，通过控制障碍函数嵌入二次规划，实现了高效、主动的安全过滤器


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统距离基于CBF的反应式激活问题，提高避障机动的平滑性和安全性，降低计算成本

Method: 利用3D高斯拷贝的分析几何特性，将每个splat转换为闭式前向碰撞凸，构建一阶控制障碍函数，并嵌入二次规划求解

Result: 在包170k个splats的大场景中，计划时间减少3倍，轨迹性性显著改善，同时保持相同的安全水平

Conclusion: 该方法全部分析、无需高阶CBF扩展，通过Minkowski和扩张自然适用于带物理维度的机器人，适用于实时空间机器人等极端环境导航

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

### [10] [Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for Sample-Efficient and Generalizable Swarm Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14431)
*Keqin Wang,Tao Zhong,David Chang,Christine Allen-Blanchette*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了LEGO框架，通过图神经网络实现置换等变性和E(n)等变性，解决多智能体强化学习在竞争性任务中的训练稳定性、泛化性和鲁棒性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习在竞争性场景中面临训练不稳定、非动能对策在恶劣条件下失效、以及策略无法泛化到不同智能体数量环境的问题。

Method: 提出LEGO框架，集成图神经网络捕捉置换等变性，规范化实现E(n)等变性，异质表示编码角色特定归纳偏置，可与MAPPO等MARL算法无缝集成。

Result: 在合作和竞争性群体基准测试中优于强基线并提升泛化能力，真实世界实验显示对团队规模变化和智能体故障具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LEGO框架有效解决了MARL在竞争性任务中的关键挑战，提供了更好的训练稳定性、泛化性和实际部署鲁棒性。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究在间歇性监控环境下，智能体如何通过心理理论(Theory of Mind)实现欺骗性行为，在追求私有目标的同时保持对监督者参考策略的表面合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实监督环境中，自主系统并非被持续监控，而是在已知时间间隔内进行间歇性观察。受人类监督者行为启发，研究如何在这样的环境下实现欺骗性行为。

Method: 利用心理理论建模监督者的期望，从中提取一个标量指标——预期偏差证据。将该标量作为状态依赖权重注入到在线强化学习的KL正则化策略改进步骤中，实现自利与合规的平滑权衡。

Result: 在海洋(ASV)和空中(UAV)导航的真实硬件实验中，ToM引导的RL方法能够在线运行，实现高回报和成功率，同时观察轨迹证据与监督者期望相校准。

Conclusion: 心理理论可以重新用于引导在线强化学习产生欺骗性行为，通过单一校准标量实现自利目标与表面合规的平衡，避免了手工或启发式策略设计。

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

*Abhiroop Ajith,Constantinos Chamzas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 通过结构约束和视觉距离结合的方法，从视觉数据中自主发现图结构化的抽象表示，支持重新排列任务的高级规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人学习中从数据自动发现抽象表示的核心挑战，提高规划框架的可扩展性和在实际领域的应用能力，避免人工编程抽象的费时费力。

Method: 结合重新排列问题的内在二分图结构特性，通过结构约束与注意力导向的视觉距离相结合，形成统一框架来引导离散的图结构化抽象。

Result: 在两个模拟重新排列任务中评估，方法能一致识别出有意义的抽象表示，支持有效规划，表现超过现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够仅从视视觉数据自主发现有用的抽象表示，为高级规划提供支持，在重新排列任务中展示出良好的性能。

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GelSight Baby Fin Ray软体机器人手，通过相机触觉传感和机器学习技术，实现了坚果壳纹理识别、力与位置估计等复杂任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索GelSight Baby Fin Ray软体机器人手的潜力，利用机器学习从高分辨率触觉图像中提取有用信息，增强软体机器人对环境的理解和交互能力。

Method: 采用相机触觉传感技术集成软体Fin Ray结构，使用ResNet50、GoogLeNet和3-5层CNN等神经网络结构进行消融研究，实现纹理识别和力/位置估计。

Result: 成功实现了坚果壳纹理的区分以及力和位置的精确估计，验证了机器学习在处理高分辨率触觉图像方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 机器学习是从触觉图像中提取有用信息的有前景技术，能够赋能软体机器人更好地理解和与环境互动。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

*Adam D. Hines,Alejandro Fontan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Event-LAB是一个统一框架，用于在多个数据集上运行基于事件的定位方法，解决了该领域代码依赖和数据格式多样化带来的比较困难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于事件的定位研究快速发展，但代码依赖和数据格式的多样化使得方法比较和实施变得困难且繁琐。

Method: 使用Pixi包和依赖管理器实现Event-LAB框架，支持单命令行安装和调用多种定位方法与数据集的组合。实现了视觉位置识别(VPR)和同步定位与建图(SLAM)两种常见管道。

Result: 框架能够系统性地可视化和分析多种方法和数据集的结果，揭示了事件收集计数和帧生成窗口大小等参数对性能的重大影响。

Conclusion: Event-LAB为研究社区提供了公平比较方法的能力，通过一致的参数设置简化了多条件实验的工作流程。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the
framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple
methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of
parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame
generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis
demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent
event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this
ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for
easily setting up multiple conditions.

Method: 设计了4-DoF SCARA机械臂配合人类远程操控界面收集数据，并使用终点辅助的动作分块Transformer(ACT)算法开发细粒度视觉运动摘野策略。

Conclusion: 该系统通过人类示范学习和修改的ACT算法，有效解决了草莓镜隔摘野的挑战，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

Motivation: 解决材料实验室振动筛自动化操作中的三个关键挑战：狭窄空间的双臂盖操作、重叠工作空间的双手交接、以及有方向约束的受阻粉末容器传递

Method: 分层规划框架结合先验引导路径规划和多步轨迹优化，使用有限高斯混合模型提高狭窄通道采样效率，并通过路径缩短、简化、关节约束和B样条平滑进行优化

Result: 规划时间减少80.4%，路径点减少89.4%，在物理实验中成功完成完整的振动筛操作工作流程

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了复杂实验室自动化中的操作挑战，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly
upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper. Researchers

Conclusion: 通过系统集成和层次优化方法，成功实现了重构化机器人对约束结构的非破坏性自动解体，充分利用了多种工具和设备的灵活性

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

Motivation: 当前的视觉-语言-动作策略在新领域机器人配置上的泛化能力有限，需要昂贵的适配成本。论文认为现有方法过于强调模型规模和数据集规模，而忽视了动作空间的设计。

Method: 论文提出了一个框架：(i)建立配置等变性理论来指导动作空间和策略设计；(ii)引入配置等变的动作解码器；(iii)统入几何感知网络架构来增强配置无关的空间推理能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实环境中的大量实验表明，该方法能够提高预训练效果，并且能够在新领域机器人配置上进行高效的微调。

Conclusion: 通过形式化跨配置预训练为设计配置变换等变的策略，该方法有效解决了配置泛化问题，为视觉-语言-动作策略的跨配置应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

TL;DR: BEV-ODOM2是一个改进的鸟瞰图视觉里程计框架，通过密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合技术，解决了现有BEV方法监督信号稀疏和信息丢失的问题，在多个数据集上实现了40%的相对平移误差改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有BEV方法在单目视觉里程计中存在监督信号稀疏和透视到BEV投影过程中的信息丢失问题，需要在不增加额外标注的情况下解决这些限制。

Method: 提出密集BEV光流监督（从3-DoF位姿真值构建）和PV-BEV融合（在投影前计算相关体积以保持6-DoF运动线索），采用三级监督机制和增强的旋转采样策略。

Result: 在KITTI、NCLT、Oxford和新收集的ZJH-VO多尺度数据集上实现了最先进性能，相对平移误差比之前的BEV方法提高了40%。

Conclusion: BEV-ODOM2有效解决了BEV方法的监督稀疏和信息丢失问题，显著提升了单目视觉里程计的性能，并发布了ZJH-VO数据集促进未来研究。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to

Motivation: 密集3D卷积虽然准确但计算成本高，不适合实时机器人系统。现有三平面方法依赖于2D图像特征和隐式MLP，计算重。

Method: 新题无插值三平面提取和体积融合框架，将3D像素直接投影到平面特征，通过广播和求和重建特征体积，将非线性移到2D卷积。添加低分辨率体积分支捕捉全局上下文。

Result: 分类和补全任务保持或提高准确度，分割和检测任务在准确度下降较少的情况下获得显著计算节省。NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano上实现稳健实时速率。

Conclusion: 该方法通过无插值设计和并行化体积融合，在保持高准确性的同时显著提高计算效率，适合嵌入式机器人视觉系统。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between
simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose
RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Abstract: Tactile-aware robot learning faces critical challenges in data collection and

Motivation: 重新研究之前提出的三环空间连杆机构，解决其自由度分析中的表面矛盾（有限DOF为3但微分DOF为5），并确定该机构是否属于摇动机构。

Method: 采用局部分析方法，计算运动学切向镜和配置空间的局部近似，进行高阶局部分析来研究机构的微分自由度和配置空间特性。

Result: 证明该连杆机构的配置空间在局部是平滑流形，参考配置不是奇异点；微分自由度在局部是常数，证明该机构属于摇动机构。

Conclusion: 这个三环空间连杆机构是一个超约束的摇动机构，其配置空间平滑且非奇异，微分自由度的常数性质证明了其摇动特性。

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Conclusion: MPPI的采样特性使其能够实时优化不连续不可微的目标，无参考方法在无人机竞速中具有显著优势，为控制器设计提供了新思路

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了非语言沟通在人机协作中的影响，通过对比LED信号单独使用与结合情感显示的效果，发现情感显示虽能提升用户互动性但对任务性能改善有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人机共享工作空间中，有效沟通对安全和效率至关重要。本文研究非语言沟通对人机交互的影响，特别是通过光信号和情感显示来传达运动意图。

Method: 使用Franka Emika Panda机器人，在末端执行器上安装LED灯带，并通过平板显示动态面部表情。进行了18名参与者的人机协作实验，评估三种条件：LED信号单独、LED信号+反应式情感显示、LED信号+预先情感显示。通过问卷和位置跟踪收集数据。

Result: 结果显示，虽然情感显示提高了机器人的互动性感知，但与单独使用LED信号相比，并未显著改善碰撞预期、沟通清晰度或任务效率。

Conclusion: 情感组件可以增强用户参与感，但在共享工作空间的任务性能方面影响有限，LED信号已足以有效传达机器人的运动意图。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments
demonstrate our method's capability for active sensing and manipulation in
confined environments.

*Humphrey Munn,Brendan Tidd,Peter Böhm,Marcus Gallagher,David Howard*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GCR-PPO是一种改进的强化学习算法，通过多目标梯度分解和冲突解决机制，解决了传统PPO在多目标任务中的梯度冲突问题，在机器人控制任务中表现出更好的可扩展性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习将多任务目标聚合为单一标量奖励，导致需要精细的奖励调优、容易陷入局部最优，且随着目标数量增加，调优成本和次优性都会增长。多目标方法在机器人RL中应用较少，主要因为计算成本和优化难度。

Method: 提出GCR-PPO算法，修改actor-critic优化过程：使用多头critic将actor更新分解为各目标的梯度，并根据目标优先级解决梯度冲突。

Result: 在IsaacLab操作和运动基准测试中，相比并行PPO表现出更好的可扩展性（p=0.04），计算开销无明显增加。在高冲突任务中性能更高，平均改进9.5%。

Conclusion: GCR-PPO通过显式处理多目标梯度冲突，有效提升了大规模PPO在多目标机器人控制任务中的性能和可扩展性，为解决复杂多目标RL问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CollabVLA是一个自反思的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过将标准视觉运动策略转化为协作助手，解决了现有VLA方法的领域过拟合、不可解释推理和高延迟等问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言-动作(VLA)系统的关键局限性，包括领域过拟合、不可解释的推理以及辅助生成模型的高延迟，使VLA从黑盒控制器转变为真正能够与人类协作的辅助智能体。

Method: 采用专家混合设计，整合了基于VLM的反思推理和基于扩散的动作生成，通过两阶段训练方法（动作基础化和反思调优）实现显式自我反思，并在遇到不确定性或重复失败时主动寻求人类指导。

Result: 与生成式智能体相比，标准化时间减少约2倍，Dream计数减少约4倍，实现了更高的成功率、改进的可解释性以及平衡的低延迟性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作在将VLA从黑盒控制器转变为真正能够推理、行动并与人类协作的辅助智能体方面迈出了开创性的一步。

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

*Shenghai Yuan,Jason Wai Hao Yee,Weixiang Guo,Zhongyuan Liu,Thien-Minh Nguyen,Lihua Xie*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: PERAL是一个用于球形机器人的感知感知运动控制框架，通过内部差速驱动实现被动LiDAR激励，无需额外硬件即可增强垂直扫描多样性，提高地图完整性和导航精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水平安装LiDAR（如MID360）在近地面捕获点云稀少的问题，传统方法如静态倾斜、主动旋转或高密度传感器要么牺牲水平感知，要么增加成本、功耗和机械复杂度。

Method: 通过建模内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合关系，在名义目标或轨迹跟踪命令上叠加有界非周期性振荡，实现被动LiDAR激励。

Result: 在实验室、走廊和战术环境中验证，实现高达96%的地图完整性，轨迹跟踪误差减少27%，并能稳健检测近地面人体，相比基线方法重量、功耗和成本更低。

Conclusion: PERAL框架无需专用硬件即可有效提升LiDAR-IMU里程计性能，在保持导航精度的同时显著改善地形感知能力，设计代码将开源。

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人软件框架在大规模视觉-语言-动作模型训练中成为瓶颈，仿真环境对真实世界实验的支持有限，需要一个新的生态系统来支持基于大规模数据收集和微调的机器人学习研究。

Method: 设计了模块化、易于扩展的分层架构RCS，提供统一的仿真和物理机器人接口，支持sim-to-real迁移，具有最小依赖但完整的功能集。

Result: 评估了RCS在VLA和RL策略开发周期中的可用性和性能，对Octo、OpenVLA和Pi Zero在多个机器人上进行了广泛评估，并展示了仿真数据如何提升真实世界策略性能。

Conclusion: RCS成功填补了机器人学习研究中的工具空白，为大规模通用策略的训练和实验提供了高效、统一的软件框架，促进了sim-to-real迁移和真实世界机器人学习研究的发展。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our
code, datasets, weights, and videos are available at:

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铰接物体操作和跨类别泛化的挑战，现有方法在这些方面存在显著困难。

Conclusion: DART框架通过结合语义理解、affordance学习和扩散策略，有效提升了铰接式灵巧操作的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

TL;DR: 多机器人连通性感知覆盖路径规划算法(Multi-CAP)，通过动态维护邻接图和车辆路由问题分解，显著提升了大规模未知环境的覆盖效率


<details>

Motivation: 解决多机器器人在大规模未知环境中协同覆盖的挑战，包括最小化总体路径长度和减少机器人间冲突

Method: 分层次的连通性感知规划算法：构建动态维护邻接图表示环境子区域，将子区域分配模式为车辆路由问题(VRP)计算无冲突旅程，各机器人在子区域内自主适应覆盖策略

Conclusion: 连通性感知图和全局旅程规划器是获得性能提升的关键因素，该方法为大规模未知环境的多机器器人协同覆盖提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Result: 在真实建筑工地数据集上的实验显示，相比自动化基线方法，在房间检测精度、地图精度和语义完整性方面均有提升

Conclusion: 该方法证明了人在环协作方法的有效性，并具有未来扩展的潜力

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Conclusion: 滑动+旋转是神经形态触觉感知在素材分类任务中的最优探索策略，具有高准确率、低功耗优势，对提升机器人环境交互能力具有重要意义。

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Conclusion: 该框架为手术室中更安全的人机交互提供了一种方法，能够有效识别和标记模糊指令，提高手术机器人助手的可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the
operating room.

Conclusion: PA-MPPI不仅能够有效解决未知环境导航问题，还可以作为导航基础模型的安全鲁棒动作策略，处理不可直接到达的目标位姿。

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

Conclusion: M4Diffuser为在非结构化环境中实现可靠的移动操作开辟了新途径，展示了优异的性能和泛化能力

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of
anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

Result: 在8个真实世界任务评估中，该框架优于现有最先进的VLA方法

Conclusion: 提出的框架和训练策略为实现协作式具身代理提供了一条可行路径

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

TL;DR: 一种为行星探测户外车设计的能源约束轨迹规划框架，结合核电源和太阳能输入，通过物理模型确保轨迹的动态可行性和能源可行性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 未来行星探测户外车需要长时间在核电源和太阳能混合功率输入下运行，但现有的轨迹规划方法往往忽视能源约束和瞬时功率限制

Method: 将物理基础的平移、旋转和阻力功率模型与基准子系统负载相结合，并将累计能源预算和瞬时功率约束集成到SE(2)基础的多项式轨迹优化中

Conclusion: 该方法为长时间行星任务提供了一种有理论基础且实用的能源意识自主规划方法，能够生成同时满足平滑性、动态可行性和功率符合性要求的轨迹

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

Motivation: 现实世界中的流式传感器数据通常噪声大、非平稳且随任务和工具变化，传统多元时间序列异常检测方法难以直接应用于强力工具使用任务。

Method: 基于扩散模型提取力-扭矩特征，使用并行异常评分评估方法，支持在线异常检测。

Conclusion: AnoF-Diff方法能有效处理强力工具使用任务中的噪声时间序列数据，提供准确的异常检测能力，适用于在线应用场景。

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.
