### [1] [GPU-Accelerated Barrier-Rate Guided MPPI Control for Tractor-Trailer Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05773)
*Keyvan Majd,Hardik Parwana,Bardh Hoxha,Steven Hong,Hideki Okamoto,Georgios Fainekos*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BR-MPPI控制方法通过嵌入CBF约束，提升了MPPI在复杂环境中的导航能力，实现了更高的实时性和避障效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决铰接式车辆在拥挤环境中倒车和机动时的导航问题，确保安全性和动态可行性。

Method: 在路径积分更新中嵌入控制屏障函数（CBF）约束，引导采样分布朝向无碰撞且动态可行的轨迹。

Result: 在高保真CarMaker模拟器中，BR-MPPI在12米拖挂车倒车和前进停车任务中表现优于标准MPPI和带碰撞成本的MPPI基线。

Conclusion: BR-MPPI在实时性和避障性能上优于传统方法，适用于复杂环境中的车辆导航。

Abstract: Articulated vehicles such as tractor-trailers, yard trucks, and similar
platforms must often reverse and maneuver in cluttered spaces where pedestrians
are present. We present how Barrier-Rate guided Model Predictive Path Integral
(BR-MPPI) control can solve navigation in such challenging environments.
BR-MPPI embeds Control Barrier Function (CBF) constraints directly into the
path-integral update. By steering the importance-sampling distribution toward
collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories, BR-MPPI enhances the
exploration strength of MPPI and improves robustness of resulting trajectories.
The method is evaluated in the high-fidelity CarMaker simulator on a 12 [m]
tractor-trailer tasked with reverse and forward parking in a parking lot.
BR-MPPI computes control inputs in above 100 [Hz] on a single GPU (for
scenarios with eight obstacles) and maintains better parking clearance than a
standard MPPI baseline and an MPPI with collision cost baseline.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach that integrates vision foundation models
with reinforcement learning to enhance object interaction capabilities in
simulated environments. By combining the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and
YOLOv5 with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent operating in the
AI2-THOR simulation environment, we enable the agent to perceive and interact
with objects more effectively. Our comprehensive experiments, conducted across
four diverse indoor kitchen settings, demonstrate significant improvements in
object interaction success rates and navigation efficiency compared to a
baseline agent without advanced perception. The results show a 68% increase in
average cumulative reward, a 52.5% improvement in object interaction success
rate, and a 33% increase in navigation efficiency. These findings highlight the
potential of integrating foundation models with reinforcement learning for
complex robotic tasks, paving the way for more sophisticated and capable
autonomous agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统刚性夹具无法适应小型家电的复杂曲面几何形状，导致拆卸困难。

Method: 开发了稳定性感知规划框架，通过采样、筛选候选接触点，并使用凸包静态稳定性标准评估配置。

Result: 与传统刚性夹具相比，新系统在螺丝拆卸任务中成功率和稳定性更高。

Conclusion: 模块化真空夹具系统显著提升了复杂几何形状物体的拆卸效率和稳定性。

Abstract: The disassembly of small household appliances poses significant challenges
due to their complex and curved geometries, which render traditional rigid
fixtures inadequate. In this paper, we propose a modular vacuum-based fixturing
system that leverages commercially available balloon-type soft grippers to
conform to arbitrarily shaped surfaces and provide stable support during
screw-removal tasks. To enable a reliable deployment of the system, we develop
a stability-aware planning framework that samples the bottom surface of the
target object, filters candidate contact points based on geometric continuity,
and evaluates support configurations using convex hull-based static stability
criteria. We compare the quality of object placement under different numbers
and configurations of balloon hands. In addition, real-world experiments were
conducted to compare the success rates of traditional rigid fixtures with our
proposed system. The results demonstrate that our method consistently achieves
higher success rates and superior placement stability during screw removal
tasks.

Result: 实验验证了系统的有效性，任务成功率提高且物体位姿偏差减少。

Conclusion: 该系统为复杂拆卸任务提供了一种直观且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Robotic non-destructive disassembly of mating parts remains challenging due
to the need for flexible manipulation and the limited visibility of internal
structures. This study presents an affordance-guided teleoperation system that
enables intuitive human demonstrations for dual-arm fix-and-disassemble tasks
for mating parts. The system visualizes feasible grasp poses and disassembly
directions in a virtual environment, both derived from the object's geometry,
to address occlusions and structural complexity. To prevent excessive position
tracking under load when following the affordance, we integrate a hybrid
controller that combines position and impedance control into the teleoperated
disassembly arm. Real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the
proposed system, showing improved task success rates and reduced object pose
deviation.

### [5] [Latent Policy Barrier: Learning Robust Visuomotor Policies by Staying In-Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05941)
*Zhanyi Sun,Shuran Song*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: LPB框架通过将专家演示的潜在嵌入作为安全与不安全状态的隐式屏障，提升了视觉运动策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决行为克隆中因协变量偏移导致的策略脆弱性问题，避免依赖人工修正或数据增强。

Method: 结合基础扩散策略和动态模型，前者专注于专家数据模仿，后者利用专家和次优策略数据预测未来状态并优化其保持在专家分布内。

Result: 模拟和真实实验表明，LPB在有限专家数据下提升了策略鲁棒性和数据效率，无需额外人工干预。

Conclusion: LPB为视觉运动策略学习提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案，适用于有限专家数据场景。

Abstract: Visuomotor policies trained via behavior cloning are vulnerable to covariate
shift, where small deviations from expert trajectories can compound into
failure. Common strategies to mitigate this issue involve expanding the
training distribution through human-in-the-loop corrections or synthetic data
augmentation. However, these approaches are often labor-intensive, rely on
strong task assumptions, or compromise the quality of imitation. We introduce
Latent Policy Barrier, a framework for robust visuomotor policy learning.
Inspired by Control Barrier Functions, LPB treats the latent embeddings of
expert demonstrations as an implicit barrier separating safe, in-distribution
states from unsafe, out-of-distribution (OOD) ones. Our approach decouples the
role of precise expert imitation and OOD recovery into two separate modules: a
base diffusion policy solely on expert data, and a dynamics model trained on
both expert and suboptimal policy rollout data. At inference time, the dynamics
model predicts future latent states and optimizes them to stay within the
expert distribution. Both simulated and real-world experiments show that LPB
improves both policy robustness and data efficiency, enabling reliable
manipulation from limited expert data and without additional human correction
or annotation.

Conclusion: 社交机器人有望提升博物馆的可访问性，尤其在小型和偏远地区博物馆。

Abstract: There are still many museums that present accessibility barriers,
particularly regarding perceptual, cultural, and cognitive aspects. This is
especially evident in low-density population areas. The aim of the ROBSO-PM
project is to improve the accessibility of small museums through the use of
social robots and social telepresence robots, focusing on three museums as case
studies: the Museum of the Holy Shroud in Turin, a small but globally known
institution, and two lesser known mountain museums: the Museum of the Champlas
du Col Carnival and the Pragelato Museum of Alpine Peoples' Costumes and
Traditions. The project explores two main applications for robots: as guides
supporting inclusive visits for foreign or disabled visitors, and as
telepresence tools allowing people with limited mobility to access museums
remotely. From a research perspective, key topics include storytelling, robot
personality, empathy, personalization, and, in the case of telepresence,
collaboration between the robot and the person, with clearly defined roles and
autonomy.

Result: 实验验证了方法的有效性，提升了跟踪精度、任务效率和能源性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境中实现了自适应和可靠的运动规划。

Abstract: Air-land bimodal vehicles provide a promising solution for navigating complex
environments by combining the flexibility of aerial locomotion with the energy
efficiency of ground mobility. To enhance the robustness of trajectory planning
under environmental disturbances, this paper presents a disturbance-aware
planning framework that incorporates real-time disturbance estimation into both
path searching and trajectory optimization. A key component of the framework is
a disturbance-adaptive safety boundary adjustment mechanism, which dynamically
modifies the vehicle's feasible dynamic boundaries based on estimated
disturbances to ensure trajectory feasibility. Leveraging the dynamics model of
the bimodal vehicle, the proposed approach achieves adaptive and reliable
motion planning across different terrains and operating conditions. A series of
real-world experiments and benchmark comparisons on a custom-built platform
validate the effectiveness and robustness of the method, demonstrating
improvements in tracking accuracy, task efficiency, and energy performance
under both ground and aerial disturbances.

### [8] [ReNiL: Relative Neural Inertial Locator with Any-Scale Bayesian Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06053)
*Kaixuan Wu,Yuanzhuo Xu,Zejun Zhang,Weiping Zhu,Steve Drew,Xiaoguang Niu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ReNiL是一个贝叶斯深度学习框架，用于高效、准确且具有不确定性感知的行人惯性定位，通过IPDPs和ASLE技术改进传统方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法依赖固定滑动窗口集成，难以适应多样化的运动尺度和步频，且不确定性估计不一致，限制了实际应用。

Method: ReNiL引入IPDPs估计运动，结合ASLE网络（融合自监督和贝叶斯回归），并通过拉普拉斯分布建模位移，提供一致的欧几里得不确定性。

Result: 在RoNIN-ds和WUDataset上，ReNiL在位移精度和不确定性一致性上优于现有方法（如TLIO、CTIN等），同时计算量更低。

Conclusion: ReNiL为移动和物联网定位提供了可扩展且具有不确定性感知的基础，展示了其鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Pedestrian inertial localization is key for mobile and IoT services because
it provides infrastructure-free positioning. Yet most learning-based methods
depend on fixed sliding-window integration, struggle to adapt to diverse motion
scales and cadences, and yield inconsistent uncertainty, limiting real-world
use. We present ReNiL, a Bayesian deep-learning framework for accurate,
efficient, and uncertainty-aware pedestrian localization. ReNiL introduces
Inertial Positioning Demand Points (IPDPs) to estimate motion at contextually
meaningful waypoints instead of dense tracking, and supports inference on IMU
sequences at any scale so cadence can match application needs. It couples a
motion-aware orientation filter with an Any-Scale Laplace Estimator (ASLE), a
dual-task network that blends patch-based self-supervision with Bayesian
regression. By modeling displacements with a Laplace distribution, ReNiL
provides homogeneous Euclidean uncertainty that integrates cleanly with other
sensors. A Bayesian inference chain links successive IPDPs into consistent
trajectories. On RoNIN-ds and a new WUDataset covering indoor and outdoor
motion from 28 participants, ReNiL achieves state-of-the-art displacement
accuracy and uncertainty consistency, outperforming TLIO, CTIN, iMoT, and RoNIN
variants while reducing computation. Application studies further show
robustness and practicality for mobile and IoT localization, making ReNiL a
scalable, uncertainty-aware foundation for next-generation positioning.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理的增量解析器，结合在线运动规划算法，使机器人能实时适应动态语言输入，无需重启执行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 在真实人机交互场景中验证，能在线调整目标位姿、约束或任务目标。

Conclusion: 增量语言理解与实时运动规划结合，提升人机协作的自然性和流畅性。

Abstract: Human-robot interaction requires robots to process language incrementally,
adapting their actions in real-time based on evolving speech input. Existing
approaches to language-guided robot motion planning typically assume fully
specified instructions, resulting in inefficient stop-and-replan behavior when
corrections or clarifications occur. In this paper, we introduce a novel
reasoning-based incremental parser which integrates an online motion planning
algorithm within the cognitive architecture. Our approach enables continuous
adaptation to dynamic linguistic input, allowing robots to update motion plans
without restarting execution. The incremental parser maintains multiple
candidate parses, leveraging reasoning mechanisms to resolve ambiguities and
revise interpretations when needed. By combining symbolic reasoning with online
motion planning, our system achieves greater flexibility in handling speech
corrections and dynamically changing constraints. We evaluate our framework in
real-world human-robot interaction scenarios, demonstrating online adaptions of
goal poses, constraints, or task objectives. Our results highlight the
advantages of integrating incremental language understanding with real-time
motion planning for natural and fluid human-robot collaboration. The
experiments are demonstrated in the accompanying video at
www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/42d5.

### [10] [Bounding Distributional Shifts in World Modeling through Novelty Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06096)
*Eric Jing,Abdeslam Boularias*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于变分自编码器的新颖性检测方法，以提高视觉世界模型的鲁棒性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉世界模型对训练质量敏感，需要近乎完全覆盖动作和状态空间以避免推理时发散。

Method: 使用变分自编码器作为新颖性检测器，确保规划中的动作轨迹不偏离训练数据分布。

Result: 在模拟机器人环境中实验，结果表明该方法在数据效率上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型预测控制策略的鲁棒性和数据效率。

Abstract: Recent work on visual world models shows significant promise in latent state
dynamics obtained from pre-trained image backbones. However, most of the
current approaches are sensitive to training quality, requiring near-complete
coverage of the action and state space during training to prevent divergence
during inference. To make a model-based planning algorithm more robust to the
quality of the learned world model, we propose in this work to use a
variational autoencoder as a novelty detector to ensure that proposed action
trajectories during planning do not cause the learned model to deviate from the
training data distribution. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, a
series of experiments in challenging simulated robot environments was carried
out, with the proposed method incorporated into a model-predictive control
policy loop extending the DINO-WM architecture. The results clearly show that
the proposed method improves over state-of-the-art solutions in terms of data
efficiency.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于时间依赖动态模型的Hyper Prediction Model（HyperPM），通过神经网络学习时间变化参数，显著减少长时预测误差，并在MPC框架中优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于梯度的MPC动态模型受限于计算复杂性和状态表示，无法准确预测未建模动态。

Method: 提出HyperPM，将未建模动态投影到时间依赖的动态模型，通过神经网络学习时间变化参数。

Result: 在F1TENTH自动驾驶赛车等挑战性系统中，显著减少长时预测误差，并在MPC框架中表现优于现有技术。

Conclusion: HyperPM在保持计算效率的同时，提升了动态模型的预测能力，为机器人控制提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is among the most widely adopted and reliable
methods for robot control, relying critically on an accurate dynamics model.
However, existing dynamics models used in the gradient-based MPC are limited by
computational complexity and state representation. To address this limitation,
we propose the Hyper Prediction Model (HyperPM) - a novel approach in which we
project the unmodeled dynamics onto a time-dependent dynamics model. This
time-dependency is captured through time-varying model parameters, whose
evolution over the MPC prediction horizon is learned using a neural network.
Such formulation preserves the computational efficiency and robustness of the
base model while equipping it with the capacity to anticipate previously
unmodeled phenomena. We evaluated the proposed approach on several challenging
systems, including real-world F1TENTH autonomous racing, and demonstrated that
it significantly reduces long-horizon prediction errors. Moreover, when
integrated within the MPC framework (HyperMPC), our method consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art techniques.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Affordance-R1 是一个统一的 affordance grounding 框架，结合了认知 Chain-of-Thought 推理和强化学习，提升了跨域泛化和显式推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型缺乏跨对象 affordance 共享和推理能力，限制了泛化和推理表现。

Method: 提出 Affordance-R1，整合认知 CoT 和 GRPO 强化学习，设计包含格式、感知和认知奖励的 affordance 函数，并使用 ReasonAff 数据集支持训练。

Result: 模型在零样本泛化和推理能力上表现优异，超越现有方法，并展示开放世界泛化能力。

Conclusion: Affordance-R1 首次将 GRPO 强化学习与推理结合，为 affordance reasoning 提供了新方向。

Abstract: Affordance grounding focuses on predicting the specific regions of objects
that are associated with the actions to be performed by robots. It plays a
vital role in the fields of human-robot interaction, human-object interaction,
embodied manipulation, and embodied perception. Existing models often neglect
the affordance shared among different objects because they lack the
Chain-of-Thought(CoT) reasoning abilities, limiting their out-of-domain (OOD)
generalization and explicit reasoning capabilities. To address these
challenges, we propose Affordance-R1, the first unified affordance grounding
framework that integrates cognitive CoT guided Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement learning paradigm. Specifically, we
designed a sophisticated affordance function, which contains format,
perception, and cognition rewards to effectively guide optimization directions.
Furthermore, we constructed a high-quality affordance-centric reasoning
dataset, ReasonAff, to support training. Trained exclusively via reinforcement
learning with GRPO and without explicit reasoning data, Affordance-R1 achieves
robust zero-shot generalization and exhibits emergent test-time reasoning
capabilities. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms
well-established methods and exhibits open-world generalization. To the best of
our knowledge, Affordance-R1 is the first to integrate GRPO-based RL with
reasoning into affordance reasoning. The code of our method and our dataset is
released on https://github.com/hq-King/Affordance-R1.

Conclusion: 研究验证了智能、上下文感知控制在工业外骨骼中的潜力。

Abstract: Back exoskeletons can reduce musculoskeletal strain, but their effectiveness
depends on support modulation and adaptive control. This study addresses two
challenges: defining optimal support strategies and developing adaptive control
based on payload estimation. We introduce an optimization space based on muscle
activity reduction, perceived discomfort, and user preference, constructing
functions to identify optimal strategies. Experiments with 12 subjects revealed
optimal operating regions, highlighting the need for dynamic modulation. Based
on these insights, we developed a vision-based adaptive control pipeline that
estimates payloads in real-time by enhancing exoskeleton contextual
understanding, minimising latency and enabling support adaptation within the
defined optimisation space. Validation with 12 more subjects showed over 80%
accuracy and improvements across all metrics. Compared to static control,
adaptive modulation reduced peak back muscle activation by up to 23% while
preserving user preference and minimising discomfort. These findings validate
the proposed framework and highlight the potential of intelligent,
context-aware control in industrial exoskeletons.

Abstract: Dynamic obstacle avoidance (DOA) is critical for quadrupedal robots operating
in environments with moving obstacles or humans. Existing approaches typically
rely on navigation-based trajectory replanning, which assumes sufficient
reaction time and leading to fails when obstacles approach rapidly. In such
scenarios, quadrupedal robots require reflexive evasion capabilities to perform
instantaneous, low-latency maneuvers. This paper introduces Reflexive Evasion
Robot (REBot), a control framework that enables quadrupedal robots to achieve
real-time reflexive obstacle avoidance. REBot integrates an avoidance policy
and a recovery policy within a finite-state machine. With carefully designed
learning curricula and by incorporating regularization and adaptive rewards,
REBot achieves robust evasion and rapid stabilization in instantaneous DOA
tasks. We validate REBot through extensive simulations and real-world
experiments, demonstrating notable improvements in avoidance success rates,
energy efficiency, and robustness to fast-moving obstacles. Videos and appendix
are available on https://rebot-2025.github.io/.

Result: 实验显示ADP在RLBench、CALVIN和真实数据集中提升了成功率、泛化能力和采样效率，执行速度提升25%，成功率提高9%。

Conclusion: ADP通过测试时自适应显著提升了扩散策略的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Diffusion policies have recently emerged as a powerful class of visuomotor
controllers for robot manipulation, offering stable training and expressive
multi-modal action modeling. However, existing approaches typically treat
action generation as an unconstrained denoising process, ignoring valuable a
priori knowledge about geometry and control structure. In this work, we propose
the Adaptive Diffusion Policy (ADP), a test-time adaptation method that
introduces two key inductive biases into the diffusion. First, we embed a
geometric manifold constraint that aligns denoising updates with task-relevant
subspaces, leveraging the fact that the relative pose between the end-effector
and target scene provides a natural gradient direction, and guiding denoising
along the geodesic path of the manipulation manifold. Then, to reduce
unnecessary exploration and accelerate convergence, we propose an analytically
guided initialization: rather than sampling from an uninformative prior, we
compute a rough registration between the gripper and target scenes to propose a
structured initial noisy action. ADP is compatible with pre-trained diffusion
policies and requires no retraining, enabling test-time adaptation that tailors
the policy to specific tasks, thereby enhancing generalization across novel
tasks and environments. Experiments on RLBench, CALVIN, and real-world dataset
show that ADPro, an implementation of ADP, improves success rates,
generalization, and sampling efficiency, achieving up to 25% faster execution
and 9% points over strong diffusion baselines.

Abstract: Existing literature proposes models for estimating the electrical power of
manipulators, yet two primary limitations prevail. First, most models are
predominantly tested using traditional industrial robots. Second, these models
often lack accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce an open source
Matlab-based library designed to automatically generate \ac{ec} models for
manipulators. The necessary inputs for the library are Denavit-Hartenberg
parameters, link masses, and centers of mass. Additionally, our model is
data-driven and requires real operational data, including joint positions,
velocities, accelerations, electrical power, and corresponding timestamps. We
validated our methodology by testing on four lightweight robots sourced from
three distinct manufacturers: Universal Robots, Franka Emika, and Kinova. The
model underwent testing, and the results demonstrated an RMSE ranging from 1.42
W to 2.80 W for the training dataset and from 1.45 W to 5.25 W for the testing
dataset.

Conclusion: PPR-AKG模型和LLM结合为工业CPPS提供了多维知识表示和直观的人机交互方式。

Abstract: Contemporary industrial cyber-physical production systems (CPPS) composed of
robotic workcells face significant challenges in the analysis of undesired
conditions due to the flexibility of Industry 4.0 that disrupts traditional
quality assurance mechanisms. This paper presents a novel industry-oriented
semantic model called Product-Process-Resource Asset Knowledge Graph (PPR-AKG),
which is designed to analyze and mitigate undesired conditions in flexible
CPPS. Built on top of the well-proven Product-Process-Resource (PPR) model
originating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses
shortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly
inadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The
integration of semantic technologies with large language models (LLMs) provides
intuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers
to interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the
use case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that
the PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on
explicitly represented capabilities as well as identification and mitigation of
undesired conditions in production. The key contributions include (1) a
holistic PPR-AKG model capturing multi-dimensional production knowledge, and
(2) the useful combination of the PPR-AKG with LLM-based chatbots for human
interaction.

TL;DR: S-Path利用3D场景图的语义结构提升路径规划效率，通过两阶段规划和子问题分解实现高效且可解释的路径规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D场景图的结构未被充分利用以提升路径规划的效率和可解释性。

Method: S-Path采用两阶段规划：先在语义图上搜索生成高层路径，再分解为并行解决的子问题，并引入重规划机制优化效率。

Result: 实验显示S-Path平均减少5.7倍规划时间，路径最优性与传统方法相当，复杂场景表现更优。

Conclusion: S-Path是一种高效且可解释的路径规划方法，适用于室内3D场景图环境。

Abstract: 3D Scene Graphs integrate both metric and semantic information, yet their
structure remains underutilized for improving path planning efficiency and
interpretability. In this work, we present S-Path, a situationally-aware path
planner that leverages the metric-semantic structure of indoor 3D Scene Graphs
to significantly enhance planning efficiency. S-Path follows a two-stage
process: it first performs a search over a semantic graph derived from the
scene graph to yield a human-understandable high-level path. This also
identifies relevant regions for planning, which later allows the decomposition
of the problem into smaller, independent subproblems that can be solved in
parallel. We also introduce a replanning mechanism that, in the event of an
infeasible path, reuses information from previously solved subproblems to
update semantic heuristics and prioritize reuse to further improve the
efficiency of future planning attempts. Extensive experiments on both
real-world and simulated environments show that S-Path achieves average
reductions of 5.7x in planning time while maintaining comparable path
optimality to classical sampling-based planners and surpassing them in complex
scenarios, making it an efficient and interpretable path planner for
environments represented by indoor 3D Scene Graphs.

Conclusion: 该方法适用于多种交互式机器人任务，仅需原始图像数据。

Abstract: A metric-accurate semantic 3D representation is essential for many robotic
tasks. This work proposes a simple, yet powerful, way to integrate the 2D
embeddings of a Vision-Language Model in a metric-accurate 3D representation at
real-time. We combine a local embedding masking strategy, for a more distinct
embedding distribution, with a confidence-weighted 3D integration for more
reliable 3D embeddings. The resulting metric-accurate embedding representation
is task-agnostic and can represent semantic concepts on a global multi-room, as
well as on a local object-level. This enables a variety of interactive robotic
applications that require the localisation of objects-of-interest via natural
language. We evaluate our approach on a variety of real-world sequences and
demonstrate that these strategies achieve a more accurate object-of-interest
localisation while improving the runtime performance in order to meet our
real-time constraints. We further demonstrate the versatility of our approach
in a variety of interactive handheld, mobile robotics and manipulation tasks,
requiring only raw image data.

Motivation: 传统CPU指标忽视了代码对机器人物理行为的影响，需从体现角度评估程序性能。

Result: 通过UR5e机器人实验比较四种程序策略，揭示了各策略的优缺点，为优化编程提供依据。

Conclusion: 基于能耗的评估方法提升了能效和可靠性，支持可持续制造和成本降低的工业目标。

Abstract: The code performance of industrial robots is typically analyzed through CPU
metrics, which overlook the physical impact of code on robot behavior. This
study introduces a novel framework for assessing robot program performance from
an embodiment perspective by analyzing the robot's electrical power profile.
Our approach diverges from conventional CPU based evaluations and instead
leverages a suite of normalized metrics, namely, the energy utilization
coefficient, the energy conversion metric, and the reliability coefficient, to
capture how efficiently and reliably energy is used during task execution.
Complementing these metrics, the established robot wear metric provides further
insight into long term reliability. Our approach is demonstrated through an
experimental case study in machine tending, comparing four programs with
diverse strategies using a UR5e robot. The proposed metrics directly compare
and categorize different robot programs, regardless of the specific task, by
linking code performance to its physical manifestation through power
consumption patterns. Our results reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each
strategy, offering actionable insights for optimizing robot programming
practices. Enhancing energy efficiency and reliability through this embodiment
centric approach not only improves individual robot performance but also
supports broader industrial objectives such as sustainable manufacturing and
cost reduction.

Conclusion: 代理增强的电机械线性驱动器模型嵌入虚拟分解控制方法，可实现全电动重型机器人操纵器的模块化实时控制。

Abstract: This paper presents a unified system-level modeling and control framework for
an all-electric heavy-duty robotic manipulator (HDRM) driven by
electromechanical linear actuators (EMLAs). A surrogate-enhanced actuator
model, combining integrated electromechanical dynamics with a neural network
trained on a dedicated testbed, is integrated into an extended virtual
decomposition control (VDC) architecture augmented by a natural adaptation law.
The derived analytical HDRM model supports a hierarchical control structure
that seamlessly maps high-level force and velocity objectives to real-time
actuator commands, accompanied by a Lyapunov-based stability proof. In
multi-domain simulations of both cubic and a custom planar triangular
trajectory, the proposed adaptive modular controller achieves sub-centimeter
Cartesian tracking accuracy. Experimental validation of the same 1-DoF platform
under realistic load emulation confirms the efficacy of the proposed control
strategy. These findings demonstrate that a surrogate-enhanced EMLA model
embedded in the VDC approach can enable modular, real-time control of an
all-electric HDRM, supporting its deployment in next-generation mobile working
machines.

Abstract: Robots should be able to learn complex behaviors from human demonstrations.
In practice, these human-provided datasets are inevitably imbalanced: i.e., the
human demonstrates some subtasks more frequently than others. State-of-the-art
methods default to treating each element of the human's dataset as equally
important. So if -- for instance -- the majority of the human's data focuses on
reaching a goal, and only a few state-action pairs move to avoid an obstacle,
the learning algorithm will place greater emphasis on goal reaching. More
generally, misalignment between the relative amounts of data and the importance
of that data causes fundamental problems for imitation learning approaches. In
this paper we analyze and develop learning methods that automatically account
for mixed datasets. We formally prove that imbalanced data leads to imbalanced
policies when each state-action pair is weighted equally; these policies
emulate the most represented behaviors, and not the human's complex, multi-task
demonstrations. We next explore algorithms that rebalance offline datasets
(i.e., reweight the importance of different state-action pairs) without human
oversight. Reweighting the dataset can enhance the overall policy performance.
However, there is no free lunch: each method for autonomously rebalancing
brings its own pros and cons. We formulate these advantages and disadvantages,
helping other researchers identify when each type of approach is most
appropriate. We conclude by introducing a novel meta-gradient rebalancing
algorithm that addresses the primary limitations behind existing approaches.
Our experiments show that dataset rebalancing leads to better downstream
learning, improving the performance of general imitation learning algorithms
without requiring additional data collection. See our project website:

Motivation: 现有外参标定方法依赖结构化目标或完全激励数据，限制了实际应用；在线标定在弱激励条件下表现不佳。

Method: 将外参标定建模为决策问题，使用Bingham分布建模3D旋转，结合轨迹对齐奖励机制和自动数据选择模块。

Result: 在无人机、无人车和手持平台上验证，性能优于传统优化方法，尤其在弱激励条件下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架简化了多机器人平台的外参标定部署，支持从常规操作数据中实现高精度标定。

Abstract: Extrinsic calibration is essential for multi-sensor fusion, existing methods
rely on structured targets or fully-excited data, limiting real-world
applicability. Online calibration further suffers from weak excitation, leading
to unreliable estimates. To address these limitations, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based extrinsic calibration framework that
formulates extrinsic calibration as a decision-making problem, directly
optimizes $SE(3)$ extrinsics to enhance odometry accuracy. Our approach
leverages a probabilistic Bingham distribution to model 3D rotations, ensuring
stable optimization while inherently retaining quaternion symmetry. A
trajectory alignment reward mechanism enables robust calibration without
structured targets by quantitatively evaluating estimated tightly-coupled
trajectory against a reference trajectory. Additionally, an automated data
selection module filters uninformative samples, significantly improving
efficiency and scalability for large-scale datasets. Extensive experiments on
UAVs, UGVs, and handheld platforms demonstrate that our method outperforms
traditional optimization-based approaches, achieving high-precision calibration
even under weak excitation conditions. Our framework simplifies deployment on
diverse robotic platforms by eliminating the need for high-quality initial
extrinsics and enabling calibration from routine operating data. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在结构化环境中，自动驾驶车辆需要生成时间最优、无碰撞且满足动态和运动学约束的轨迹。

Method: V*采用六边形离散化策略，动态生成图，结合几何剪枝和数学建模（如转向动力学的指数收敛），确保动态可行性。

Result: 仿真研究表明，V*能够在复杂动态环境中生成安全高效的轨迹，具备主动避障和动态协调能力。

Conclusion: V*通过直接集成动态约束和高维搜索优化，提供了一种无需后处理的动态可行运动规划解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle navigation in structured environments requires planners
capable of generating time-optimal, collision-free trajectories that satisfy
dynamic and kinematic constraints. We introduce V*, a graph-based motion
planner that represents speed and direction as explicit state variables within
a discretised space-time-velocity lattice. Unlike traditional methods that
decouple spatial search from dynamic feasibility or rely on post-hoc smoothing,
V* integrates both motion dimensions directly into graph construction through
dynamic graph generation during search expansion. To manage the complexity of
high-dimensional search, we employ a hexagonal discretisation strategy and
provide formal mathematical proofs establishing optimal waypoint spacing and
minimal node redundancy under constrained heading transitions for
velocity-aware motion planning. We develop a mathematical formulation for
transient steering dynamics in the kinematic bicycle model, modelling steering
angle convergence with exponential behaviour, and deriving the relationship for
convergence rate parameters. This theoretical foundation, combined with
geometric pruning strategies that eliminate expansions leading to infeasible
steering configurations, enables V* to evaluate dynamically admissible
manoeuvres, ensuring each trajectory is physically realisable without further
refinement. We further demonstrate V*'s performance in simulation studies with
cluttered and dynamic environments involving moving obstacles, showing its
ability to avoid conflicts, yield proactively, and generate safe, efficient
trajectories with temporal reasoning capabilities for waiting behaviours and
dynamic coordination.

Abstract: Generalist robot policies trained on large-scale datasets such as Open
X-Embodiment (OXE) demonstrate strong performance across a wide range of tasks.
However, they often struggle to generalize beyond the distribution of their
training data. In this paper, we investigate the underlying cause of this
limited generalization capability. We identify shortcut learning -- the
reliance on task-irrelevant features -- as a key impediment to generalization.
Through comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we uncover two
primary contributors to shortcut learning: (1) limited diversity within
individual sub-datasets, and (2) significant distributional disparities across
sub-datasets, leading to dataset fragmentation. These issues arise from the
inherent structure of large-scale datasets like OXE, which are typically
composed of multiple sub-datasets collected independently across varied
environments and embodiments. Our findings provide critical insights into
dataset collection strategies that can reduce shortcut learning and enhance the
generalization ability of generalist robot policies. Moreover, in scenarios
where acquiring new large-scale data is impractical, we demonstrate that
carefully selected robotic data augmentation strategies can effectively reduce
shortcut learning in existing offline datasets, thereby improving
generalization capabilities of generalist robot policies, e.g., $\pi_0$, in
both simulation and real-world environments. More information at
