In this context, Dynamic Motion Primitives offer built - in stability\nand robustness to disturbances but often struggle to capture complex periodic\nbehaviors.

These shortcomings substantially narrow their applicability,\nexcluding a wide class of practically meaningful tasks such as locomotion and\nrhythmic tool use.

Furthermore, by\nconditioning the bijective encoder on the task, we enable a single learned\npolicy to represent multiple motion objectives, yielding consistent zero-shot\ngeneralization to unseen motion objectives within the training distribution.

Previous works in unseen\nobject instance segmentation (UOIS) train models on large-scale datasets, which\noften leads to overfitting on static visual features. This dependency results\nin poor generalization performance when confronted with out-of-distribution\nscenarios. To address this limitation, we rethink the task of UOIS based on the\nprinciple that vision is inherently interactive and occurs over time. We\npropose a novel real-time interactive perception framework, rt-RISeg, that\ncontinuously segments unseen objects by robot interactions and analysis of a\ndesigned body frame-invariant feature (BFIF). We demonstrate that the relative\nrotational and linear velocities of randomly sampled body frames, resulting\nfrom selected robot interactions, can be used to identify objects without any\nlearned segmentation model. This fully self-contained segmentation pipeline\ngenerates and updates object segmentation masks throughout each robot\ninteraction without the need to wait for an action to finish.

In these unstructured settings, conventional navigation systems that\nrely on fixed parameters often fail to generalize across scenarios, resulting\nin degraded performance and reduced social acceptance. Although recent\napproaches have leveraged reinforcement learning to enhance traditional\nplanners, these methods often fail in real-world deployments due to poor\ngeneralization and limited simulation diversity, which hampers effective\nsim-to-real transfer. To tackle these issues, we present LE-Nav, an\ninterpretable and scene-aware navigation framework that leverages multi-modal\nlarge language model reasoning and conditional variational autoencoders to\nadaptively tune planner hyperparameters.

To address these difficulties, especially in scenarios with sparse\nviews and dynamic environments, we introduce TRAN-D, a novel 2D Gaussian\nSplatting-based depth reconstruction method for transparent objects. Our key\ninsight lies in separating transparent objects from the background, enabling\nfocused optimization of Gaussians corresponding to the object. We mitigate\nartifacts with an object-aware loss that places Gaussians in obscured regions,\nensuring coverage of invisible surfaces while reducing overfitting.\nFurthermore, we incorporate a physics-based simulation that refines the\nreconstruction in just a few seconds, effectively handling object removal and\nchain-reaction movement of remaining objects without the need for rescanning.\nTRAN-D is evaluated on both synthetic and real-world sequences, and it\nconsistently demonstrated robust improvements over existing GS-based\nstate-of-the-art methods. In comparison with baselines, TRAN-D reduces the mean\nabsolute error by over 39% for the synthetic TRansPose sequences. Furthermore,\ndespite being updated using only one image, TRAN-D reaches a {\\delta} < 2.5 cm\naccuracy of 48.46%, over 1.5 times that of baselines, which uses six images.\nCode and more results are available at https://jeongyun0609.github.io/TRAN-D/.", "AI": {"tldr": "TRAN-D\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e2D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u7684\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u6df1\u5ea6\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u76843D\u51e0\u4f55\u91cd\u5efa\u56e0\u53cd\u5c04\u548c\u6298\u5c04\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u7279\u6027\u800c\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "TRAN-D\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u79bb\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u4e0e\u80cc\u666f\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u635f\u5931\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7269\u7406\u6a21\u62df\u5feb\u901f\u4f18\u5316\u91cd\u5efa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cTRAN-D\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e39%\uff0c\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe48.46%\u3002", "conclusion": "TRAN-D\u5728\u900f\u660e\u7269\u4f53\u91cd\u5efa\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u89c6\u56fe\u573a\u666f\u3002"}}

It not only improves\ndisinfection efficiency but also minimizes unnecessary exposure in low-risk\nareas. In two representative hospital scenarios, our method achieves the same\ndisinfection effectiveness while reducing disinfection time by 30.7% and 31.9%,\nrespectively.

The framework invokes two processes asynchronously at high\nfrequency: (i) a centralized, discrete, and full-horizon planner for computing\ncollision- and deadlock-free paths rapidly, leveraging recent advances in\nmulti-agent pathfinding (MAPF), and (ii) dynamics-aware, robot-wise optimal\ntrajectory controllers that ensure all robots independently follow their\nassigned paths reliably. This hierarchical shift in planning representation\nfrom (i) discrete and coupled to (ii) continuous and decoupled domains enables\nthe framework to maintain long-term scalable motion synthesis. As an\ninstantiation of this idea, we present LF, which combines a fast\nstate-of-the-art MAPF solver (LaCAM), and a robust feedback control stack\n(Freyja) for executing agile robot maneuvers. LF provides a robust and\nversatile mechanism for lifelong multi-robot navigation even under asynchronous\nand partial goal updates, and adapts to dynamic workspaces simply by quick\nreplanning.

Musical tasks, like drumming, present unique\nchallenges, including split-second timing, rapid contacts, and multi-limb\ncoordination over pieces lasting minutes. In this paper, we introduce Robot\nDrummer, a humanoid system capable of expressive, high-precision drumming\nacross a diverse repertoire of songs. We formulate humanoid drumming as\nsequential fulfillment of timed-contacts and transform drum scores in to a\nRhythmic Contact Chain. To handle the long-horizon nature of musical\nperformance, we decompose each piece into fixed-length segments and train a\nsingle policy across all segments in parallel using reinforcement learning.\nThrough extensive experiments on over thirty popular rock, metal, and jazz\ntracks, our results demonstrate that Robot Drummer consistently achieves high\nF1 scores. The learned behaviors exhibit emergent human-like drumming\nstrategies, such as cross-arm strikes, and adaptive sticks assignments,\ndemonstrating the potential of reinforcement learning to bring humanoid robots\ninto the domain of creative musical performance.

Our method employs an ensemble of LLM evaluators, each\nconfigured with distinct prompting techniques to identify linguistic,\ncontextual, procedural, and critical ambiguities. A chain-of-thought evaluator\nis included to systematically analyze instruction structure for potential\nissues. Individual evaluator assessments are synthesized through conformal\nprediction, which yields non-conformity scores based on comparison to a labeled\ncalibration dataset. Evaluating Llama 3.2 11B and Gemma 3 12B, we observed\nclassification accuracy exceeding 60% in differentiating ambiguous from\nunambiguous surgical instructions.
