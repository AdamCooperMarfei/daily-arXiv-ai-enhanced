Conclusion: 该方法在单轴和多轴抓取中均有效，减少了冲击力并提高了任务可行性。

Abstract: Robotic catching of flying objects typically generates high impact forces
that might lead to task failure and potential hardware damages. This is
accentuated when the object mass to robot payload ratio increases, given the
strong inertial components characterizing this task. This paper aims to address
this problem by proposing an implicitly impact-aware framework that
accomplishes the catching task in both pre- and post-catching phases. In the
first phase, a motion planner generates optimal trajectories that minimize
catching forces, while in the second, the object's energy is dissipated
smoothly, minimizing bouncing. In particular, in the pre-catching phase, a
real-time optimal planner is responsible for generating trajectories of the
end-effector that minimize the velocity difference between the robot and the
object to reduce impact forces during catching. In the post-catching phase, the
robot's position, velocity, and stiffness trajectories are generated based on
human demonstrations when catching a series of free-falling objects with
unknown masses. A hierarchical quadratic programming-based controller is used
to enforce the robot's constraints (i.e., joint and torque limits) and create a
stack of tasks that minimizes the reflected mass at the end-effector as a
secondary objective. The initial experiments isolate the problem along one
dimension to accurately study the effects of each contribution on the metrics
proposed. We show how the same task, without velocity matching, would be
infeasible due to excessive joint torques resulting from the impact. The
addition of reflected mass minimization is then investigated, and the catching
height is increased to evaluate the method's robustness. Finally, the setup is
extended to catching along multiple Cartesian axes, to prove its generalization
in space.

unknown fuel costs. We develop a two-phase solution: an offline heuristic-based
planner computes initial UAV and UGV paths, and a novel online planning
algorithm that dynamically adjusts rendezvous points based on real-time fuel
consumption during target processing. Preliminary Gazebo simulations
demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in maintaining UAV-UGV path
validity, ensuring mission completion. Link to video:

### [3] [Model-Based Real-Time Pose and Sag Estimation of Overhead Power Lines Using LiDAR for Drone Inspection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20812)

Conclusion: 该方法在复杂环境下实现了高效准确的电力线跟踪，适用于无人机电力线检测。

Abstract: Drones can inspect overhead power lines while they remain energized,
significantly simplifying the inspection process. However, localizing a drone
relative to all conductors using an onboard LiDAR sensor presents several
challenges: (1) conductors provide minimal surface for LiDAR beams limiting the
number of conductor points in a scan, (2) not all conductors are consistently
detected, and (3) distinguishing LiDAR points corresponding to conductors from
other objects, such as trees and pylons, is difficult. This paper proposes an
estimation approach that minimizes the error between LiDAR measurements and a
single geometric model representing the entire conductor array, rather than
tracking individual conductors separately. Experimental results, using data
from a power line drone inspection, demonstrate that this method achieves
accurate tracking, with a solver converging under 50 ms per frame, even in the
presence of partial observations, noise, and outliers. A sensitivity analysis
shows that the estimation approach can tolerate up to twice as many outlier
points as valid conductors measurements.

Abstract: A cooperative circumnavigation framework is proposed for multi-quadrotor
systems to enclose and track a moving target without reliance on external
localization systems. The distinct relationships between quadrotor-quadrotor
and quadrotor-target interactions are evaluated using a heterogeneous
perception strategy and corresponding state estimation algorithms. A modified
Kalman filter is developed to fuse visual-inertial odometry with range
measurements to enhance the accuracy of inter-quadrotor relative localization.
An event-triggered distributed Kalman filter is designed to achieve robust
target state estimation under visual occlusion by incorporating neighbor
measurements and estimated inter-quadrotor relative positions. Using the
estimation results, a cooperative circumnavigation controller is constructed,
leveraging an oscillator-based autonomous formation flight strategy. We conduct
extensive indoor and outdoor experiments to validate the efficiency of the
proposed circumnavigation framework in occluded environments. Furthermore, a
quadrotor failure experiment highlights the inherent fault tolerance property
of the proposed framework, underscoring its potential for deployment in
search-and-rescue operations.

Conclusion: 本文从人类运动学习角度全面概述了VLA模型后训练方法，并为模型开发提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Vision-language-action (VLA) models extend vision-language models (VLM) by
integrating action generation modules for robotic manipulation. Leveraging
strengths of VLM in vision perception and instruction understanding, VLA models
exhibit promising generalization across diverse manipulation tasks. However,
applications demanding high precision and accuracy reveal performance gaps
without further adaptation. Evidence from multiple domains highlights the
critical role of post-training to align foundational models with downstream
applications, spurring extensive research on post-training VLA models. VLA
model post-training aims to address the challenge of improving an embodiment's
ability to interact with the environment for the given tasks, analogous to the
process of humans motor skills acquisition. Accordingly, this paper reviews
post-training strategies for VLA models through the lens of human motor
learning, focusing on three dimensions: environments, embodiments, and tasks. A
structured taxonomy is introduced aligned with human learning mechanisms: (1)
enhancing environmental perception, (2) improving embodiment awareness, (3)
deepening task comprehension, and (4) multi-component integration. Finally, key
challenges and trends in post-training VLA models are identified, establishing
a conceptual framework to guide future research. This work delivers both a
comprehensive overview of current VLA model post-training methods from a human
motor learning perspective and practical insights for VLA model development.

Abstract: Autonomous systems rely on sensors to estimate the environment around them.
However, cameras, LiDARs, and RADARs have their own limitations. In nighttime
or degraded environments such as fog, mist, or dust, thermal cameras can
provide valuable information regarding the presence of objects of interest due
to their heat signature. They make it easy to identify humans and vehicles that
are usually at higher temperatures compared to their surroundings. In this
paper, we focus on the adaptation of thermal cameras for robotics and
automation, where the biggest hurdle is the lack of data. Several multi-modal
datasets are available for driving robotics research in tasks such as scene
segmentation, object detection, and depth estimation, which are the cornerstone
of autonomous systems. However, they are found to be lacking in thermal
imagery. Our paper proposes a solution to augment these datasets with synthetic
thermal data to enable widespread and rapid adaptation of thermal cameras. We
explore the use of conditional diffusion models to convert existing RGB images
to thermal images using self-attention to learn the thermal properties of
real-world objects.

Result: 在VirtualHome WAH-NL和真实机器人实验中，成功率分别达34%和25%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: STEP框架有效提升长时程任务规划的成功率，适用于实际机器人应用。

Abstract: The ability to perform reliable long-horizon task planning is crucial for
deploying robots in real-world environments. However, directly employing Large
Language Models (LLMs) as action sequence generators often results in low
success rates due to their limited reasoning ability for long-horizon embodied
tasks. In the STEP framework, we construct a subgoal tree through a pair of
closed-loop models: a subgoal decomposition model and a leaf node termination
model. Within this framework, we develop a hierarchical tree structure that
spans from coarse to fine resolutions. The subgoal decomposition model
leverages a foundation LLM to break down complex goals into manageable
subgoals, thereby spanning the subgoal tree. The leaf node termination model
provides real-time feedback based on environmental states, determining when to
terminate the tree spanning and ensuring each leaf node can be directly
converted into a primitive action. Experiments conducted in both the
VirtualHome WAH-NL benchmark and on real robots demonstrate that STEP achieves
long-horizon embodied task completion with success rates up to 34% (WAH-NL) and
25% (real robot) outperforming SOTA methods.

Conclusion: V2X-REALM提升了端到端协作自动驾驶的可扩展性。

Abstract: Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.

Abstract: Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm in robot manipulation,
yet its generalization capability remains constrained by object-specific
dependencies in limited expert demonstrations. To address this challenge, we
propose knowledge-driven imitation learning, a framework that leverages
external structural semantic knowledge to abstract object representations
within the same category. We introduce a novel semantic keypoint graph as a
knowledge template and develop a coarse-to-fine template-matching algorithm
that optimizes both structural consistency and semantic similarity. Evaluated
on three real-world robotic manipulation tasks, our method achieves superior
performance, surpassing image-based diffusion policies with only one-quarter of
the expert demonstrations. Extensive experiments further demonstrate its
robustness across novel objects, backgrounds, and lighting conditions. This
work pioneers a knowledge-driven approach to data-efficient robotic learning in
real-world settings. Code and more materials are available on

Abstract: The control of marine robots has long relied on model-based methods grounded
in classical and modern control theory. However, the nonlinearity and
uncertainties inherent in robot dynamics, coupled with the complexity of marine
environments, have revealed the limitations of conventional control methods.
The rapid evolution of machine learning has opened new avenues for
incorporating data-driven intelligence into control strategies, prompting a
paradigm shift in the control of marine robots. This paper provides a review of
recent progress in marine robot control through the lens of this emerging
paradigm. The review covers both individual and cooperative marine robotic
systems, highlighting notable achievements in data-driven control of marine
robots and summarizing open-source resources that support the development and
validation of advanced control methods. Finally, several future perspectives
are outlined to guide research toward achieving high-level autonomy for marine
robots in real-world applications. This paper aims to serve as a roadmap toward
the next-generation control framework of marine robots in the era of
data-driven intelligence.

Result: CURL-SLAM在3D地图质量和轨迹精度上达到先进水平，并在CPU上实现10Hz的实时性能。

Conclusion: CURL-SLAM为LiDAR SLAM提供了一种高效、紧凑且一致的解决方案，未来将开源实现。

Abstract: This paper studies 3D LiDAR mapping with a focus on developing an updatable
and localizable map representation that enables continuity, compactness and
consistency in 3D maps. Traditional LiDAR Simultaneous Localization and Mapping
(SLAM) systems often rely on 3D point cloud maps, which typically require
extensive storage to preserve structural details in large-scale environments.
In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm for LiDAR SLAM by leveraging the
Continuous and Ultra-compact Representation of LiDAR (CURL) introduced in [1].
Our proposed LiDAR mapping approach, CURL-SLAM, produces compact 3D maps
capable of continuous reconstruction at variable densities using CURL's
spherical harmonics implicit encoding, and achieves global map consistency
after loop closure. Unlike popular Iterative Closest Point (ICP)-based LiDAR
odometry techniques, CURL-SLAM formulates LiDAR pose estimation as a unique
optimization problem tailored for CURL and extends it to local Bundle
Adjustment (BA), enabling simultaneous pose refinement and map correction.
Experimental results demonstrate that CURL-SLAM achieves state-of-the-art 3D
mapping quality and competitive LiDAR trajectory accuracy, delivering
sensor-rate real-time performance (10 Hz) on a CPU. We will release the
CURL-SLAM implementation to the community.

Result: DRA-MPPI在真实和模拟实验中表现优于现有方法（如S-MPC、Frenet规划器和原始MPPI），有效解决了“冻结机器人”问题并提升了安全性。

Conclusion: DRA-MPPI是一种高效且安全的运动规划方法，适用于动态环境中的机器人导航。

Abstract: Deploying mobile robots safely among humans requires the motion planner to
account for the uncertainty in the other agents' predicted trajectories. This
remains challenging in traditional approaches, especially with arbitrarily
shaped predictions and real-time constraints. To address these challenges, we
propose a Dynamic Risk-Aware Model Predictive Path Integral control (DRA-MPPI),
a motion planner that incorporates uncertain future motions modelled with
potentially non-Gaussian stochastic predictions. By leveraging MPPI's
gradient-free nature, we propose a method that efficiently approximates the
joint Collision Probability (CP) among multiple dynamic obstacles for several
hundred sampled trajectories in real-time via a Monte Carlo (MC) approach. This
enables the rejection of samples exceeding a predefined CP threshold or the
integration of CP as a weighted objective within the navigation cost function.
Consequently, DRA-MPPI mitigates the freezing robot problem while enhancing
safety. Real-world and simulated experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles
demonstrate DRA-MPPI's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, including Scenario-based Model Predictive Control (S-MPC), Frenet
planner, and vanilla MPPI.

Conclusion: ACTLLM通过语言和视觉的协同优化，显著提升了动态环境中的机器人操作能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces ACTLLM (Action Consistency Tuned Large Language Model),
a novel approach for robot manipulation in dynamic environments. Traditional
vision-based systems often struggle to learn visual representations that excel
in both task execution and spatial reasoning, thereby limiting their
adaptability in dynamic environments. ACTLLM addresses these challenges by
harnessing language to craft structured scene descriptors, providing a uniform
interface for both spatial understanding and task performance through flexible
language instructions. Moreover, we introduce a novel action consistency
constraint that aligns visual perception with corresponding actions, thereby
enhancing the learning of actionable visual representations. Additionally, we
have reformulated the Markov decision process for manipulation tasks into a
multi-turn visual dialogue framework. This approach enables the modeling of
long-term task execution with enhanced contextual relevance derived from the
history of task execution. During our evaluation, ACTLLM excels in diverse
scenarios, proving its effectiveness on challenging vision-based robot
manipulation tasks.

Result: ADRC显著降低了轨迹跟踪误差，但增加了控制能耗；海上试验中能耗进一步增加。

Conclusion: ADRC在轨迹跟踪性能上优于PID控制器，但需权衡其增加的能耗问题。

Abstract: Unmanned Surface Vessels (USVs) face significant control challenges due to
uncertain environmental disturbances like waves and currents. This paper
proposes a trajectory tracking controller based on Active Disturbance Rejection
Control (ADRC) implemented on the DUS V2500. A custom simulation incorporating
realistic waves and current disturbances is developed to validate the
controller's performance, supported by further validation through field tests
in the harbour of Scheveningen, the Netherlands, and at sea. Simulation results
demonstrate that ADRC significantly reduces cross-track error across all tested
conditions compared to a baseline PID controller but increases control effort
and energy consumption. Field trials confirm these findings while revealing a
further increase in energy consumption during sea trials compared to the
baseline.

Abstract: This research addresses critical autonomous vehicle control challenges
arising from road roughness variation, which induces course deviations and
potential loss of road contact during steering operations. We present a novel
real-time road roughness estimation system employing Bayesian calibration
methodology that processes axle accelerations to predict terrain roughness with
quantifiable confidence measures. The technical framework integrates a Gaussian
process surrogate model with a simulated half-vehicle model, systematically
processing vehicle velocity and road surface roughness parameters to generate
corresponding axle acceleration responses. The Bayesian calibration routine
performs inverse estimation of road roughness from observed accelerations and
velocities, yielding posterior distributions that quantify prediction
uncertainty for adaptive risk management. Training data generation utilizes
Latin Hypercube sampling across comprehensive velocity and roughness parameter
spaces, while the calibrated model integrates seamlessly with a Simplex
controller architecture to dynamically adjust velocity limits based on
real-time roughness predictions. Experimental validation on stochastically
generated surfaces featuring varying roughness regions demonstrates robust
real-time characterization capabilities, with the integrated Simplex control
strategy effectively enhancing autonomous vehicle operational safety through
proactive surface condition response. This innovative Bayesian framework
establishes a comprehensive foundation for mitigating roughness-related
operational risks while simultaneously improving efficiency and safety margins
in autonomous vehicle systems.

Abstract: We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.
