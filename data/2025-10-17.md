### [1] [A Diffusion-Refined Planner with Reinforcement Learning Priors for Confined-Space Parking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14000)
*Mingyang Jiang,Yueyuan Li,Jiaru Zhang,Songan Zhang,Ming Yang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出DRIP方法，结合强化学习先验和扩散模型，用于受限空间停车规划，提高规划成功率和推理效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 停车需求增长需要自动化停车规划方法，现有方法在受限复杂环境中难以准确建模最优动作分布

Method: 使用RL预训练策略提供先验动作分布来正则化扩散训练过程，推理时通过去噪过程将粗略先验精炼为更精确的动作分布

Result: 在具有不同空间约束的停车场景中显著提高了规划性能，在受限空间停车环境中保持强泛化能力

Conclusion: DRIP方法通过RL先验引导扩散模型，实现了更准确的动作建模、更高的规划成功率和更少的推理步骤

Abstract: The growing demand for parking has increased the need for automated parking
planning methods that can operate reliably in confined spaces. In restricted
and complex environments, high-precision maneuvers are required to achieve a
high success rate in planning, yet existing approaches often rely on explicit
action modeling, which faces challenges when accurately modeling the optimal
action distribution. In this paper, we propose DRIP, a diffusion-refined
planner anchored in reinforcement learning (RL) prior action distribution, in
which an RL-pretrained policy provides prior action distributions to regularize
the diffusion training process. During the inference phase the denoising
process refines these coarse priors into more precise action distributions. By
steering the denoising trajectory through the reinforcement learning prior
distribution during training, the diffusion model inherits a well-informed
initialization, resulting in more accurate action modeling, a higher planning
success rate, and reduced inference steps. We evaluate our approach across
parking scenarios with varying degrees of spatial constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method significantly improves planning performance
in confined-space parking environments while maintaining strong generalization
in common scenarios.

### [2] [Spatially Intelligent Patrol Routes for Concealed Emitter Localization by Robot Swarms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14018)
*Adam Morris,Timothy Pelham,Edmund R. Hunt*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种设计空间智能机器人群体行为的方法，用于定位隐藏的无线电发射器，通过差分进化生成几何巡逻路线，不依赖发射器参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电磁监视中定位未知信号的关键挑战，特别是独立于发射器参数进行定位的难题。

Method: 使用差分进化生成几何巡逻路线，模拟四机器人群体在八种配置下的行为，基于指定巡逻形状和感知能力（全向或定向天线）分配预生成巡逻路线。

Result: 定向天线平均检测成功率98.75%，全向天线80.25%；定向天线定位误差1.01-1.30米，全向天线1.67-1.90米；定向天线巡逻边更短。

Conclusion: 群体预测电磁现象的能力直接依赖于其与环境的物理交互，空间智能（通过优化巡逻路线和天线选择实现）是有效机器人监视的关键设计考虑因素。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for designing spatially intelligent robot
swarm behaviors to localize concealed radio emitters. We use differential
evolution to generate geometric patrol routes that localize unknown signals
independently of emitter parameters, a key challenge in electromagnetic
surveillance. Patrol shape and antenna type are shown to influence information
gain, which in turn determines the effective triangulation coverage. We
simulate a four-robot swarm across eight configurations, assigning
pre-generated patrol routes based on a specified patrol shape and sensing
capability (antenna type: omnidirectional or directional). An emitter is placed
within the map for each trial, with randomized position, transmission power and
frequency. Results show that omnidirectional localization success rates are
driven primarily by source location rather than signal properties, with
failures occurring most often when sources are placed in peripheral areas of
the map. Directional antennas are able to overcome this limitation due to their
higher gain and directivity, with an average detection success rate of 98.75%
compared to 80.25% for omnidirectional. Average localization errors range from
1.01-1.30 m for directional sensing and 1.67-1.90 m for omnidirectional
sensing; while directional sensing also benefits from shorter patrol edges.
These results demonstrate that a swarm's ability to predict electromagnetic
phenomena is directly dependent on its physical interaction with the
environment. Consequently, spatial intelligence, realized here through
optimized patrol routes and antenna selection, is a critical design
consideration for effective robotic surveillance.

### [3] [Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for Heterogeneous Robot Teaming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14063)
*Nan Li,Jiming Ren,Haris Miller,Samuel Coogan,Karen M. Feigh,Ye Zhao*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出OATH框架，通过自适应Halton序列地图和集群拍卖选择机制，解决多智能体任务分配中的可扩展性、空间推理和障碍物环境适应性挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体任务分配在可扩展性、空间推理和障碍物丰富环境适应性方面仍面临挑战，需要新的解决方案。

Method: 1. 开发自适应Halton序列地图，基于障碍物分布调整采样密度；2. 提出集群-拍卖-选择框架，结合障碍感知聚类、加权拍卖和集群内任务选择；3. 利用LLM解释人类指令实时指导规划器。

Result: 在NVIDIA Isaac Sim中验证，相比现有MATP基线方法，在任务分配质量、可扩展性、动态变化适应性和整体执行性能方面均有显著提升。

Conclusion: OATH框架通过障碍感知策略有效协调异构机器人团队，保持可扩展性和接近最优的分配性能。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Task Assignment and Planning (MATP) has attracted growing
attention but remains challenging in terms of scalability, spatial reasoning,
and adaptability in obstacle-rich environments. To address these challenges, we
propose OATH: Adaptive Obstacle-Aware Task Assignment and Planning for
Heterogeneous Robot Teaming, which advances MATP by introducing a novel
obstacle-aware strategy for task assignment. First, we develop an adaptive
Halton sequence map, the first known application of Halton sampling with
obstacle-aware adaptation in MATP, which adjusts sampling density based on
obstacle distribution. Second, we propose a cluster-auction-selection framework
that integrates obstacle-aware clustering with weighted auctions and
intra-cluster task selection. These mechanisms jointly enable effective
coordination among heterogeneous robots while maintaining scalability and
near-optimal allocation performance. In addition, our framework leverages an
LLM to interpret human instructions and directly guide the planner in real
time. We validate OATH in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, showing substantial improvements in
task assignment quality, scalability, adaptability to dynamic changes, and
overall execution performance compared to state-of-the-art MATP baselines. A
project website is available at https://llm-oath.github.io/.

### [4] [Optimistic Reinforcement Learning-Based Skill Insertions for Task and Motion Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14065)
*Gaoyuan Liu,Joris de Winter,Yuri Durodie,Denis Steckelmacher,Ann Nowe,Bram Vanderborght*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种将强化学习技能集成到任务与运动规划中的方法，通过数据驱动的逻辑组件和计划精炼子程序来处理概率性技能的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TAMP在处理概率性动作时存在挑战，而RL虽然能获得鲁棒的短视界操作技能，但缺乏长视界推理能力。需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 设计RL技能的数据驱动逻辑组件，使其能被符号规划部署，并设计计划精炼子程序处理效果不确定性。

Result: 实验表明该方法扩展了TAMP处理概率性技能的能力，相比之前方法提高了规划效率。

Conclusion: 通过嵌入RL技能，成功扩展了TAMP在概率技能领域的应用能力，并提升了规划效率。

Abstract: Task and motion planning (TAMP) for robotics manipulation necessitates
long-horizon reasoning involving versatile actions and skills. While
deterministic actions can be crafted by sampling or optimizing with certain
constraints, planning actions with uncertainty, i.e., probabilistic actions,
remains a challenge for TAMP. On the contrary, Reinforcement Learning (RL)
excels in acquiring versatile, yet short-horizon, manipulation skills that are
robust with uncertainties. In this letter, we design a method that integrates
RL skills into TAMP pipelines. Besides the policy, a RL skill is defined with
data-driven logical components that enable the skill to be deployed by symbolic
planning. A plan refinement sub-routine is designed to further tackle the
inevitable effect uncertainties. In the experiments, we compare our method with
baseline hierarchical planning from both TAMP and RL fields and illustrate the
strength of the method. The results show that by embedding RL skills, we extend
the capability of TAMP to domains with probabilistic skills, and improve the
planning efficiency compared to the previous methods.

Motivation: 为建筑工地起重机应用开发稳定控制方法，处理重物搬运和保持任务，考虑系统欠驱动特性和耦合动力学。

Method: 采用部分反馈线性化控制方法，利用系统耦合动力学进行稳定，仅使用机载传感器，适合户外应用。

Result: 数值稳定性分析表明耦合项对系统稳定至关重要，在风扰、传感器噪声和系统不确定性下具有鲁棒性，通过仿真和实验验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的控制方法能有效稳定悬挂空中平台，适用于户外建筑工地应用，具有良好的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: In this work, we present a novel control approach based on partial feedback
linearization (PFL) for the stabilization of a suspended aerial platform with
an attached load. Such systems are envisioned for various applications in
construction sites involving cranes, such as the holding and transportation of
heavy objects. Our proposed control approach considers the underactuation of
the whole system while utilizing its coupled dynamics for stabilization. We
demonstrate using numerical stability analysis that these coupled terms are
crucial for the stabilization of the complete system. We also carried out
robustness analysis of the proposed approach in the presence of external wind
disturbances, sensor noise, and uncertainties in system dynamics. As our
envisioned target application involves cranes in outdoor construction sites,
our control approaches rely on only onboard sensors, thus making it suitable
for such applications. We carried out extensive simulation studies and
experimental tests to validate our proposed control approach.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViTacGen是一个机器人操作框架，通过视觉到触觉生成网络从视觉图像序列生成接触深度图像，结合强化学习策略实现无需真实触觉传感器的视觉机器人推送任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实触觉传感器存在成本高、易损坏、校准困难和传感器间差异等问题，而纯视觉策略性能不足，因此需要一种能够从视觉推断触觉状态的方法。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器视觉到触觉生成网络生成接触深度图像，结合基于对比学习的强化学习策略融合视觉和生成触觉数据。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界实验中验证了方法的有效性，实现了高达86%的成功率。

Conclusion: ViTacGen框架能够有效消除对高分辨率真实触觉传感器的依赖，实现视觉机器人系统的零样本部署。

Abstract: Robotic pushing is a fundamental manipulation task that requires tactile
feedback to capture subtle contact forces and dynamics between the end-effector
and the object. However, real tactile sensors often face hardware limitations
such as high costs and fragility, and deployment challenges involving
calibration and variations between different sensors, while vision-only
policies struggle with satisfactory performance. Inspired by humans' ability to
infer tactile states from vision, we propose ViTacGen, a novel robot
manipulation framework designed for visual robotic pushing with vision-to-touch
generation in reinforcement learning to eliminate the reliance on
high-resolution real tactile sensors, enabling effective zero-shot deployment
on visual-only robotic systems. Specifically, ViTacGen consists of an
encoder-decoder vision-to-touch generation network that generates contact depth
images, a standardized tactile representation, directly from visual image
sequence, followed by a reinforcement learning policy that fuses visual-tactile
data with contrastive learning based on visual and generated tactile
observations. We validate the effectiveness of our approach in both simulation
and real world experiments, demonstrating its superior performance and
achieving a success rate of up to 86\%.

Abstract: Manipulating three-dimensional (3D) deformable objects presents significant
challenges for robotic systems due to their infinite-dimensional state space
and complex deformable dynamics. This paper proposes a novel model-free
approach for shape control with constraints imposed on key points. Unlike
existing methods that rely on feature dimensionality reduction, the proposed
controller leverages the coordinates of key points as the feature vector, which
are extracted from the deformable object's point cloud using deep learning
methods. This approach not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature space
but also retains the spatial information of the object. By extracting key
points, the manipulation of deformable objects is simplified into a visual
servoing problem, where the shape dynamics are described using a deformation
Jacobian matrix. To enhance control accuracy, a prescribed performance control
method is developed by integrating barrier Lyapunov functions (BLF) to enforce
constraints on the key points. The stability of the closed-loop system is
rigorously analyzed and verified using the Lyapunov method. Experimental
results further demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然机械臂的顺从人机协作已广泛发展，但由于人形机器人复杂的全身动力学，实现顺从的人-人形机器人协作仍未被充分探索。

Method: 使用仅本体感觉的强化学习方法，在闭环环境中训练单一策略，结合领导者和跟随者行为，通过协调轨迹规划预测物体运动模式和人类意图。

Result: 模拟实验显示减少24.7%的人类努力，真实世界实验验证了在不同物体类型和运动模式下的鲁棒性，用户研究显示相比基线模型平均提升27.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法无需外部传感器或复杂交互模型即可实现顺从的人-人形协作搬运，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Human-humanoid collaboration shows significant promise for applications in
healthcare, domestic assistance, and manufacturing. While compliant robot-human
collaboration has been extensively developed for robotic arms, enabling
compliant human-humanoid collaboration remains largely unexplored due to
humanoids' complex whole-body dynamics. In this paper, we propose a
proprioception-only reinforcement learning approach, COLA, that combines leader
and follower behaviors within a single policy. The model is trained in a
closed-loop environment with dynamic object interactions to predict object
motion patterns and human intentions implicitly, enabling compliant
collaboration to maintain load balance through coordinated trajectory planning.
We evaluate our approach through comprehensive simulator and real-world
experiments on collaborative carrying tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness,
generalization, and robustness of our model across various terrains and
objects. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our model reduces human effort
by 24.7%. compared to baseline approaches while maintaining object stability.
Real-world experiments validate robust collaborative carrying across different
object types (boxes, desks, stretchers, etc.) and movement patterns
(straight-line, turning, slope climbing). Human user studies with 23
participants confirm an average improvement of 27.4% compared to baseline
models. Our method enables compliant human-humanoid collaborative carrying
without requiring external sensors or complex interaction models, offering a
practical solution for real-world deployment.

TL;DR: AdaMoE是一种基于混合专家(MoE)架构的视觉-语言-动作模型，通过继承预训练密集模型的权重，并将前馈层替换为稀疏激活的MoE层来扩展动作专家，实现了计算效率与性能的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VLA模型扩展面临的两个关键挑战：(1)从头训练需要大量计算资源和数据集，而机器人数据稀缺；(2)实时控制需要平衡模型容量与计算效率。

Method: 提出AdaMoE架构，采用解耦技术将专家选择与专家权重分配分离，通过独立的尺度适配器与传统路由器协同工作，实现基于任务相关性的专家选择和独立控制的权重贡献。

Result: 在关键基准测试中表现优于基线模型：LIBERO上提升1.8%，RoboTwin上提升9.3%，真实世界实验中大幅提升21.5%。

Conclusion: 通过协作式专家利用而非赢家通吃机制，可以在保持计算效率的同时实现更优性能，证明了专业知识无需垄断。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are experiencing rapid development and
demonstrating promising capabilities in robotic manipulation tasks. However,
scaling up VLA models presents several critical challenges: (1) Training new
VLA models from scratch demands substantial computational resources and
extensive datasets. Given the current scarcity of robot data, it becomes
particularly valuable to fully leverage well-pretrained VLA model weights
during the scaling process. (2) Real-time control requires carefully balancing
model capacity with computational efficiency. To address these challenges, We
propose AdaMoE, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that inherits
pretrained weights from dense VLA models, and scales up the action expert by
substituting the feedforward layers into sparsely activated MoE layers. AdaMoE
employs a decoupling technique that decouples expert selection from expert
weighting through an independent scale adapter working alongside the
traditional router. This enables experts to be selected based on task relevance
while contributing with independently controlled weights, allowing
collaborative expert utilization rather than winner-takes-all dynamics. Our
approach demonstrates that expertise need not monopolize. Instead, through
collaborative expert utilization, we can achieve superior performance while
maintaining computational efficiency. AdaMoE consistently outperforms the
baseline model across key benchmarks, delivering performance gains of 1.8% on
LIBERO and 9.3% on RoboTwin. Most importantly, a substantial 21.5% improvement
in real-world experiments validates its practical effectiveness for robotic
manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一种风险感知的四足机器人强化学习方法，使用CVaR约束策略优化训练风险条件策略族，并通过多臂老虎机框架在线自适应选择最优策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决四足机器人在未知环境中鲁棒性不足的问题，通过风险感知学习提高在动态变化、接触干扰、传感噪声和复杂地形等未知条件下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效训练具有不同鲁棒性水平的四足机器人运动策略，并在未知环境中在线自适应选择最优策略，显著提升了在未知条件下的性能表现。

Abstract: In this work, we study risk-aware reinforcement learning for quadrupedal
locomotion. Our approach trains a family of risk-conditioned policies using a
Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) constrained policy optimization technique that
provides improved stability and sample efficiency. At deployment, we adaptively
select the best performing policy from the family of policies using a
multi-armed bandit framework that uses only observed episodic returns, without
any privileged environment information, and adapts to unknown conditions on the
fly. Hence, we train quadrupedal locomotion policies at various levels of
robustness using CVaR and adaptively select the desired level of robustness
online to ensure performance in unknown environments. We evaluate our method in
simulation across eight unseen settings (by changing dynamics, contacts,
sensing noise, and terrain) and on a Unitree Go2 robot in previously unseen
terrains. Our risk-aware policy attains nearly twice the mean and tail
performance in unseen environments compared to other baselines and our
bandit-based adaptation selects the best-performing risk-aware policy in
unknown terrain within two minutes of operation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 农业机器人导航指令经常重复出现，但现有方法将每个指令视为独立事件，忽略了利用过往经验提供空间上下文的能力

Method: 使用空间理解记忆模块，通过3D重建和表示来保存空间记忆，为后续导航指令提供空间上下文

Result: 在A2A基准测试中，成功率达到0.54，导航误差为2.93米，相比基线方法成功率和导航误差都有改善

Conclusion: SUM-AgriVLN在农业视觉语言导航领域实现了最先进的性能，证明了空间记忆对重复导航任务的重要性

Abstract: Agricultural robots are emerging as powerful assistants across a wide range
of agricultural tasks, nevertheless, still heavily rely on manual operation or
fixed rail systems for movement. The AgriVLN method and the A2A benchmark
pioneeringly extend Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) to the agricultural
domain, enabling robots to navigate to the target positions following the
natural language instructions. In practical agricultural scenarios, navigation
instructions often repeatedly occur, yet AgriVLN treat each instruction as an
independent episode, overlooking the potential of past experiences to provide
spatial context for subsequent ones. To bridge this gap, we propose the method
of Spatial Understanding Memory for Agricultural Vision-and-Language Navigation
(SUM-AgriVLN), in which the SUM module employs spatial understanding and save
spatial memory through 3D reconstruction and representation. When evaluated on
the A2A benchmark, our SUM-AgriVLN effectively improves Success Rate from 0.47
to 0.54 with slight sacrifice on Navigation Error from 2.91m to 2.93m,
demonstrating the state-of-the-art performance in the agricultural domain.

Abstract: This study presents a powered transtibial prosthesis with complete push-off
assistance, RoboANKLE. The design aims to fulfill specific requirements, such
as a sufficient range of motion (RoM) while providing the necessary torque for
achieving natural ankle motion in daily activities. Addressing the challenges
faced in designing active transtibial prostheses, such as maintaining energetic
autonomy and minimizing weight, is vital for the study. With this aim, we try
to imitate the human ankle by providing extensive push-off assistance to
achieve a natural-like torque profile. Thus, Energy Store and Extended Release
mechanism (ESER) is employed with a novel Extra Energy Storage (EES) mechanism.
Kinematic and kinetic analyses are carried out to determine the design
parameters and assess the design performance. Subsequently, a Computer-Aided
Design (CAD) model is built and used in comprehensive dynamic and structural
analyses. These analyses are used for the design performance evaluation and
determine the forces and torques applied to the prosthesis, which aids in
optimizing the design for minimal weight via structural analysis and topology
optimization. The design of the prototype is then finalized and manufactured
for experimental evaluation to validate the design and functionality. The
prototype is realized with a mass of 1.92 kg and dimensions of 261x107x420 mm.
The Functional evaluations of the RoboANKLE revealed that it is capable of
achieving the natural maximum dorsi-flexion angle with 95% accuracy. Also,
Thanks to the implemented mechanisms, the results show that RoboANKLE can
generate 57% higher than the required torque for natural walking. The result of
the power generation capacity of the RoboANKLE is 10% more than the natural
power during the gait cycle.

Conclusion: AdaMimic成功结合了运动先验的适应性和运动跟踪的准确性，实现了从单一参考运动的高质量人形机器人控制。

Abstract: Humanoid robots are envisioned to adapt demonstrated motions to diverse
real-world conditions while accurately preserving motion patterns. Existing
motion prior approaches enable well adaptability with a few motions but often
sacrifice imitation accuracy, whereas motion-tracking methods achieve accurate
imitation yet require many training motions and a test-time target motion to
adapt. To combine their strengths, we introduce AdaMimic, a novel motion
tracking algorithm that enables adaptable humanoid control from a single
reference motion. To reduce data dependence while ensuring adaptability, our
method first creates an augmented dataset by sparsifying the single reference
motion into keyframes and applying light editing with minimal physical
assumptions. A policy is then initialized by tracking these sparse keyframes to
generate dense intermediate motions, and adapters are subsequently trained to
adjust tracking speed and refine low-level actions based on the adjustment,
enabling flexible time warping that further improves imitation accuracy and
adaptability. We validate these significant improvements in our approach in
both simulation and the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot in multiple tasks
across a wide range of adaptation conditions. Videos and code are available at

Abstract: Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn a policy from expert demonstrations and
has been applied to various applications. By learning from the expert policy,
IL methods do not require environmental interactions or reward signals.
However, most existing imitation learning algorithms assume perfect expert
demonstrations, but expert demonstrations often contain imperfections caused by
errors from human experts or sensor/control system inaccuracies. To address the
above problems, this work proposes a filter-and-restore framework to best
leverage expert demonstrations with inherent noise. Our proposed method first
filters clean samples from the demonstrations and then learns conditional
diffusion models to recover the noisy ones. We evaluate our proposed framework
and existing methods in various domains, including robot arm manipulation,
dexterous manipulation, and locomotion. The experiment results show that our
proposed framework consistently outperforms existing methods across all the
tasks. Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each component
and demonstrate the framework's robustness to different noise types and levels.
These results confirm the practical applicability of our framework to noisy
offline demonstration data.

Result: 发现刚度增加会非线性地减少最大可容忍时延，增加系统脆弱性；实验显示稳定性与运动性能相关。

Conclusion: 提出的稳定性标准可推广到各种机器人介导的交互，为有效的时延补偿策略提供先决条件。

Abstract: This paper establishes analytical stability criteria for robot-mediated
human-human (dyadic) interaction systems, focusing on haptic communication
under network-induced time delays. Through frequency-domain analysis supported
by numerical simulations, we identify both delay-independent and
delay-dependent stability criteria. The delay-independent criterion guarantees
stability irrespective of the delay, whereas the delay-dependent criterion is
characterised by a maximum tolerable delay before instability occurs. The
criteria demonstrate dependence on controller and robot dynamic parameters,
where increasing stiffness reduces the maximum tolerable delay in a non-linear
manner, thereby heightening system vulnerability. The proposed criteria can be
generalised to a wide range of robot-mediated interactions and serve as design
guidelines for stable remote dyadic systems. Experiments with robots performing
human-like movements further illustrate the correlation between stability and
motor performance. The findings of this paper suggest the prerequisites for
effective delay-compensation strategies.

Abstract: Embeddings from Visual-Language Models are increasingly utilized to represent
semantics in robotic maps, offering an open-vocabulary scene understanding that
surpasses traditional, limited labels. Embeddings enable on-demand querying by
comparing embedded user text prompts to map embeddings via a similarity metric.
The key challenge in performing the task indicated in a query is that the robot
must determine the parts of the environment relevant to the query.
  This paper proposes a solution to this challenge. We leverage
natural-language synonyms and antonyms associated with the query within the
embedding space, applying heuristics to estimate the language space relevant to
the query, and use that to train a classifier to partition the environment into
matches and non-matches. We evaluate our method through extensive experiments,
querying both maps and standard image benchmarks. The results demonstrate
increased queryability of maps and images. Our querying technique is agnostic
to the representation and encoder used, and requires limited training.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了无模型统一的抓取-放置推理，能够处理未知物体和真实世界感知噪声，在非平面支撑上表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: To reliably pick and place unknown objects under real-world sensing noise
remains a challenging task, as existing methods rely on strong object priors
(e.g., CAD models), or planar-support assumptions, limiting generalization and
unified reasoning between grasping and placing. In this work, we introduce a
generalized placeability metric that evaluates placement poses directly from
noisy point clouds, without any shape priors. The metric jointly scores
stability, graspability, and clearance. From raw geometry, we extract the
support surfaces of the object to generate diverse candidates for
multi-orientation placement and sample contacts that satisfy collision and
stability constraints. By conditioning grasp scores on each candidate
placement, our proposed method enables model-free unified pick-and-place
reasoning and selects grasp-place pairs that lead to stable, collision-free
placements. On unseen real objects and non-planar object supports, our metric
delivers CAD-comparable accuracy in predicting stability loss and generally
produces more physically plausible placements than learning-based predictors.

Motivation: 传统时间序列处理方法难以有效捕捉多通道本体感知信号间的相关性和步态依赖模式，需要一种能保留机器人形态结构并增强特征表达的表示方法。

Method: 将多通道本体感知信号（关节位置、IMU读数、足端速度等）按机器人形态结构空间排列编码为二维图像，利用CNN处理这种跨模态表示。

Result: 在真实世界和仿真环境中，图像表示方法相比传统序列模型显著提升预测准确率和泛化能力，接触状态准确率从87.7%提升至94.5%，且使用15倍更短的窗口大小。

Conclusion: 跨模态编码策略在机器人状态学习中具有巨大潜力，图像表示能有效捕捉信号间相关性和步态模式，为运动相关任务提供更丰富的特征空间。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for representing proprioceptive
time-series data from quadruped robots as structured two-dimensional images,
enabling the use of convolutional neural networks for learning
locomotion-related tasks. The proposed method encodes temporal dynamics from
multiple proprioceptive signals, such as joint positions, IMU readings, and
foot velocities, while preserving the robot's morphological structure in the
spatial arrangement of the image. This transformation captures inter-signal
correlations and gait-dependent patterns, providing a richer feature space than
direct time-series processing. We apply this concept in the problem of contact
estimation, a key capability for stable and adaptive locomotion on diverse
terrains. Experimental evaluations on both real-world datasets and simulated
environments show that our image-based representation consistently enhances
prediction accuracy and generalization over conventional sequence-based models,
underscoring the potential of cross-modal encoding strategies for robotic state
learning. Our method achieves superior performance on the contact dataset,
improving contact state accuracy from 87.7% to 94.5% over the recently proposed
MI-HGNN method, using a 15 times shorter window size.

Result: 在7自由度机械臂上评估，相比现有方法能生成高质量多模态轨迹，时间大幅减少，能泛化到未见环境

Conclusion: CAMPD展示了扩散模型在运动规划中的潜力，提供了一种传感器无关的通用解决方案

Abstract: Classical methods in robot motion planning, such as sampling-based and
optimization-based methods, often struggle with scalability towards
higher-dimensional state spaces and complex environments. Diffusion models,
known for their capability to learn complex, high-dimensional and multi-modal
data distributions, provide a promising alternative when applied to motion
planning problems and have already shown interesting results. However, most of
the current approaches train their model for a single environment, limiting
their generalization to environments not seen during training. The techniques
that do train a model for multiple environments rely on a specific camera to
provide the model with the necessary environmental information and therefore
always require that sensor. To effectively adapt to diverse scenarios without
the need for retraining, this research proposes Context-Aware Motion Planning
Diffusion (CAMPD). CAMPD leverages a classifier-free denoising probabilistic
diffusion model, conditioned on sensor-agnostic contextual information. An
attention mechanism, integrated in the well-known U-Net architecture,
conditions the model on an arbitrary number of contextual parameters. CAMPD is
evaluated on a 7-DoF robot manipulator and benchmarked against state-of-the-art
approaches on real-world tasks, showing its ability to generalize to unseen
environments and generate high-quality, multi-modal trajectories, at a fraction
of the time required by existing methods.

Conclusion: GOPLA框架通过结合语义推理和几何规划，有效解决了机器人物体放置问题，在真实场景中实现了优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Robots are expected to serve as intelligent assistants, helping humans with
everyday household organization. A central challenge in this setting is the
task of object placement, which requires reasoning about both semantic
preferences (e.g., common-sense object relations) and geometric feasibility
(e.g., collision avoidance). We present GOPLA, a hierarchical framework that
learns generalizable object placement from augmented human demonstrations. A
multi-modal large language model translates human instructions and visual
inputs into structured plans that specify pairwise object relationships. These
plans are then converted into 3D affordance maps with geometric common sense by
a spatial mapper, while a diffusion-based planner generates placement poses
guided by test-time costs, considering multi-plan distributions and collision
avoidance. To overcome data scarcity, we introduce a scalable pipeline that
expands human placement demonstrations into diverse synthetic training data.
Extensive experiments show that our approach improves placement success rates
by 30.04 percentage points over the runner-up, evaluated on positioning
accuracy and physical plausibility, demonstrating strong generalization across
a wide range of real-world robotic placement scenarios.

Abstract: We present a generative predictive control (GPC) framework that amortizes
sampling-based Model Predictive Control (SPC) by bootstrapping it with
conditional flow-matching models trained on SPC control sequences collected in
simulation. Unlike prior work relying on iterative refinement or gradient-based
solvers, we show that meaningful proposal distributions can be learned directly
from noisy SPC data, enabling more efficient and informed sampling during
online planning. We further demonstrate, for the first time, the application of
this approach to real-world contact-rich loco-manipulation with a quadruped
robot. Extensive experiments in simulation and on hardware show that our method
improves sample efficiency, reduces planning horizon requirements, and
generalizes robustly across task variations.

Motivation: 现有视觉触觉学习方法难以处理亚毫米级精度的任务，而传统基于模型的方法却能轻松应对。关键限制在于当前学习框架未能有效利用触觉信号的感知丰富性及其与手部运动学的空间关系。

Conclusion: 空间锚定的触觉表示使策略能够进行精确的几何推理，在需要高精度的灵巧操作任务中取得显著性能提升。

Abstract: Dexterous manipulation requires precise geometric reasoning, yet existing
visuo-tactile learning methods struggle with sub-millimeter precision tasks
that are routine for traditional model-based approaches. We identify a key
limitation: while tactile sensors provide rich contact information, current
learning frameworks fail to effectively leverage both the perceptual richness
of tactile signals and their spatial relationship with hand kinematics. We
believe an ideal tactile representation should explicitly ground contact
measurements in a stable reference frame while preserving detailed sensory
information, enabling policies to not only detect contact occurrence but also
precisely infer object geometry in the hand's coordinate system. We introduce
SaTA (Spatially-anchored Tactile Awareness for dexterous manipulation), an
end-to-end policy framework that explicitly anchors tactile features to the
hand's kinematic frame through forward kinematics, enabling accurate geometric
reasoning without requiring object models or explicit pose estimation. Our key
insight is that spatially grounded tactile representations allow policies to
not only detect contact occurrence but also precisely infer object geometry in
the hand's coordinate system. We validate SaTA on challenging dexterous
manipulation tasks, including bimanual USB-C mating in free space, a task
demanding sub-millimeter alignment precision, as well as light bulb
installation requiring precise thread engagement and rotational control, and
card sliding that demands delicate force modulation and angular precision.
These tasks represent significant challenges for learning-based methods due to
their stringent precision requirements. Across multiple benchmarks, SaTA
significantly outperforms strong visuo-tactile baselines, improving success
rates by up to 30 percentage while reducing task completion times by 27
percentage.

<details>

Motivation: 传统基于规则的交通代理（如IDM）行为简单被动，无法充分测试规划器的复杂交互能力，可能掩盖规划器缺陷并导致评估偏差。

Method: 将最先进的学习型交通代理模型SMART集成到nuPlan仿真平台中，在更真实的条件下评估14个近期规划器和基准方法。

Result: IDM仿真高估规划性能：几乎所有分数都下降。但许多规划器在复杂交互场景中表现优于预期。闭环训练的方法表现最稳定，但在边缘案例中学习型规划器会突然退化。

Conclusion: 建议将SMART反应式仿真作为nuPlan的新标准闭环基准，并发布了SMART代理作为IDM的替代方案。

Abstract: Planner evaluation in closed-loop simulation often uses rule-based traffic
agents, whose simplistic and passive behavior can hide planner deficiencies and
bias rankings. Widely used IDM agents simply follow a lead vehicle and cannot
react to vehicles in adjacent lanes, hindering tests of complex interaction
capabilities. We address this issue by integrating the state-of-the-art learned
traffic agent model SMART into nuPlan. Thus, we are the first to evaluate
planners under more realistic conditions and quantify how conclusions shift
when narrowing the sim-to-real gap. Our analysis covers 14 recent planners and
established baselines and shows that IDM-based simulation overestimates
planning performance: nearly all scores deteriorate. In contrast, many planners
interact better than previously assumed and even improve in multi-lane,
interaction-heavy scenarios like lane changes or turns. Methods trained in
closed-loop demonstrate the best and most stable driving performance. However,
when reaching their limits in augmented edge-case scenarios, all learned
planners degrade abruptly, whereas rule-based planners maintain reasonable
basic behavior. Based on our results, we suggest SMART-reactive simulation as a
new standard closed-loop benchmark in nuPlan and release the SMART agents as a
drop-in alternative to IDM at https://github.com/shgd95/InteractiveClosedLoop.

Conclusion: CADRE框架通过接触感知的动态恢复方法有效解决了灵巧操作中的恢复问题，证明了接触特征在提高训练效率和泛化能力方面的重要性

Abstract: Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and
disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the
manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of
catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and,
importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the
primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a
reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field
(NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods
that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason
about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries.
Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training
efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately
leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE
can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.

Abstract: Autonomous drone racing (ADR) systems have recently achieved champion-level
performance, yet remain highly specific to drone racing. While end-to-end
vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date
simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and
champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of
our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly
from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on
informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world
model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By
extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model
effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly
improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid,
resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from
the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration,
enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining.
Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight,
executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder,
reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further
demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on
poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion
by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its
flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to
important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving
extremely high-speed, agile flight.

Conclusion: 该方法为建模复杂人类运动模式提供了一种强大而高效的方式

Abstract: Safe and efficient robot operation in complex human environments can benefit
from good models of site-specific motion patterns. Maps of Dynamics (MoDs)
provide such models by encoding statistical motion patterns in a map, but
existing representations use discrete spatial sampling and typically require
costly offline construction. We propose a continuous spatio-temporal MoD
representation based on implicit neural functions that directly map coordinates
to the parameters of a Semi-Wrapped Gaussian Mixture Model. This removes the
need for discretization and imputation for unevenly sampled regions, enabling
smooth generalization across both space and time. Evaluated on a large public
dataset with long-term real-world people tracking data, our method achieves
better accuracy of motion representation and smoother velocity distributions in
sparse regions while still being computationally efficient, compared to
available baselines. The proposed approach demonstrates a powerful and
efficient way of modeling complex human motion patterns.

Abstract: Real-world robotic manipulation in homes and factories demands reliability,
efficiency, and robustness that approach or surpass skilled human operators. We
present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on
diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces
a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors.
Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy
Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are
applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement.
Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An
additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step
sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling
high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while
preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and
representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a
variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We
evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control,
such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth
folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100
attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900
episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The
method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于声学目标定位的多智能体切换模式控制策略，包括单源定位的刚性编队控制和多源场景的独立搜索


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 声学传感器能够在无法建立直接视线的情况下定位目标，这在机器人研究中具有重要意义

Method: 设计了多智能体切换模式控制策略，包含两种场景：单源定位时保持刚性编队，多源场景中各智能体独立搜索

Result: 实现了在单源和多源场景下的声学目标定位控制

Conclusion: 该切换模式控制策略能够有效处理不同场景下的声学目标定位问题

Abstract: Source seeking is an important topic in robotic research, especially
considering sound-based sensors since they allow the agents to locate a target
even in critical conditions where it is not possible to establish a direct line
of sight. In this work, we design a multi- agent switching mode control
strategy for acoustic-based target localization. Two scenarios are considered:
single source localization, in which the agents are driven maintaining a rigid
formation towards the target, and multi-source scenario, in which each agent
searches for the targets independently from the others.

Conclusion: Sadcher框架在异构多机器人任务分配中表现出色，具有实时性、可扩展性和泛化能力，并发布了包含25万个最优调度的数据集。

Abstract: We present Sadcher, a real-time task assignment framework for heterogeneous
multi-robot teams that incorporates dynamic coalition formation and task
precedence constraints. Sadcher is trained through Imitation Learning and
combines graph attention and transformers to predict assignment rewards between
robots and tasks. Based on the predicted rewards, a relaxed bipartite matching
step generates high-quality schedules with feasibility guarantees. We
explicitly model robot and task positions, task durations, and robots'
remaining processing times, enabling advanced temporal and spatial reasoning
and generalization to environments with different spatiotemporal distributions
compared to training. Trained on optimally solved small-scale instances, our
method can scale to larger task sets and team sizes. Sadcher outperforms other
learning-based and heuristic baselines on randomized, unseen problems for small
and medium-sized teams with computation times suitable for real-time operation.
We also explore sampling-based variants and evaluate scalability across robot
and task counts. In addition, we release our dataset of 250,000 optimal
schedules: https://autonomousrobots.nl/paper_websites/sadcher_MRTA/

TL;DR: STITCHER是一种无优化的规划框架，通过将短轨迹段拼接与图搜索结合，实时计算长距离、表达性强且接近最优的轨迹，在高速自主导航中优于基于优化的规划器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于数值优化的现代轨迹规划技术在安全关键场景中面临计算时间要求和数值不稳定性的限制，需要开发实时、稳定且满足各种约束的规划方法。

Method: 采用无优化规划框架，通过拼接短轨迹段与图搜索相结合，实现了创新的规划架构和算法开发，能够在实时条件下生成满足动态可行性、无碰撞和状态/执行器约束的轨迹。

Conclusion: STITCHER框架证明了无优化方法在实时高速导航中的有效性，能够处理传统优化规划器难以包含的非凸约束，为安全关键应用提供了可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous high-speed navigation through large, complex environments requires
real-time generation of agile trajectories that are dynamically feasible,
collision-free, and satisfy state or actuator constraints. Modern trajectory
planning techniques primarily use numerical optimization, as they enable the
systematic computation of high-quality, expressive trajectories that satisfy
various constraints. However, stringent requirements on computation time and
the risk of numerical instability can limit the use of optimization-based
planners in safety-critical scenarios. This work presents an optimization-free
planning framework called STITCHER that stitches short trajectory segments
together with graph search to compute long-range, expressive, and near-optimal
trajectories in real-time. STITCHER outperforms modern optimization-based
planners through our innovative planning architecture and several algorithmic
developments that make real-time planning possible. Extensive simulation
testing is performed to analyze the algorithmic components that make up
STITCHER, along with a thorough comparison with two state-of-the-art
optimization planners. Simulation tests show that safe trajectories can be
created within a few milliseconds for paths that span the entirety of two 50 m
x 50 m environments. Hardware tests with a custom quadrotor verify that
STITCHER can produce trackable paths in real-time while respecting nonconvex
constraints, such as limits on tilt angle and motor forces, which are otherwise
hard to include in optimization-based planners.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了VLA^2框架，通过集成外部模块（网络检索和物体检测）来增强VLA模型处理分布外对象的能力，在困难级别泛化基准上相比OpenVLA基线提升了44.2%的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在处理训练数据中未见过的物体概念（如新物体描述和纹理）时，成功率显著下降，需要解决这种泛化失败问题。

Method: 基于OpenVLA作为执行主干，集成外部模块（网络检索和物体检测）为目标物体提供视觉和文本知识，构建了包含三个难度级别的评估基准。

Result: 在设计的困难级别泛化基准上优于当前最先进模型，相比OpenVLA基线在困难级别基准上成功率提升44.2%，在所有定制环境中平均提升20.2%，且不影响域内任务性能。

Conclusion: VLA^2框架通过利用外部知识有效缓解了VLA模型处理分布外对象的泛化失败问题，在保持域内任务性能的同时显著提升了泛化能力。

Abstract: Current vision-language-action (VLA) models, pre-trained on large-scale
robotic data, exhibit strong multi-task capabilities and generalize well to
variations in visual and language instructions for manipulation. However, their
success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the
training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset.
To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages
OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules
such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual
knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates
generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the
LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object
descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty
levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully
outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level
generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2
achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark
and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any
performance degradation on in-domain tasks. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过丰富的触觉反馈适应双手机器人装配任务的能力难以通过行为克隆在机器人中复制，因为人类演示存在次优性和多样性有限的问题。

Method: 首先在少量演示上使用同步视觉和触觉输入训练扩散策略，然后将该策略转移到配备模拟触觉传感器的数字孪生中，通过大规模强化学习进行细化以增强鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，VT-Refine通过增加数据多样性和实现更有效的策略微调，提高了模拟和真实世界中的装配性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了精确、接触丰富的双手机器人装配问题，实现了从模拟到真实的有效转移。

Abstract: Humans excel at bimanual assembly tasks by adapting to rich tactile feedback
-- a capability that remains difficult to replicate in robots through
behavioral cloning alone, due to the suboptimality and limited diversity of
human demonstrations. In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile
policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations,
high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise,
contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a
small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This
policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated
tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to
enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer,
we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal
force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using
GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves
assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data
diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning. Our project page is

TL;DR: 分层控制架构（LCA）通过高速本体感觉稳定器和低速感知策略的结合，在非结构化环境中实现比端到端设计更稳健的人形机器人运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在非结构化环境中实现稳健的人形机器人运动需要平衡快速低级稳定和慢速感知决策的架构。

Method: 采用两层控制架构：高速运行的本体感觉稳定器和紧凑的低速感知策略，通过两阶段训练课程（盲稳定器预训练和感知微调）进行训练。

Result: 在Unitree G1人形机器人上，该方法在楼梯和边缘任务中取得成功，而单阶段感知策略失败。分层策略在仿真和硬件中始终优于单阶段替代方案。

Conclusion: 时间尺度的架构分离，而非网络规模或复杂性，是实现稳健感知条件运动的关键推动因素。

Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires
architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual
decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a
proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate
perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than
monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders.
Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed
by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently
outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree
G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage
perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation
of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for
robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

TL;DR: RoboGhost是一个直接从语言到动作的人形机器人框架，通过绕过显式的运动解码和重定向，使用基于扩散的策略直接从噪声中生成可执行动作，显著降低了延迟并提高了成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言引导的人形机器人运动流程存在多阶段处理导致的累积误差、高延迟以及语义与控制之间弱耦合的问题，需要更直接的语言到动作路径。

Method: 提出RoboGhost框架，使用基于扩散的策略直接在人形策略上条件化语言基础的运动潜变量，通过混合因果变换器-扩散运动生成器确保长期一致性。

Result: 实验表明RoboGhost显著降低了部署延迟，提高了成功率和跟踪精度，在真实人形机器人上产生平滑、语义对齐的运动。

Conclusion: RoboGhost提供了一个通用的视觉-语言-动作人形系统基础，可自然扩展到图像、音频和音乐等其他模态。

Abstract: Natural language offers a natural interface for humanoid robots, but existing
language-guided humanoid locomotion pipelines remain cumbersome and unreliable.
They typically decode human motion, retarget it to robot morphology, and then
track it with a physics-based controller. However, this multi-stage process is
prone to cumulative errors, introduces high latency, and yields weak coupling
between semantics and control. These limitations call for a more direct pathway
from language to action, one that eliminates fragile intermediate stages.
Therefore, we present RoboGhost, a retargeting-free framework that directly
conditions humanoid policies on language-grounded motion latents. By bypassing
explicit motion decoding and retargeting, RoboGhost enables a diffusion-based
policy to denoise executable actions directly from noise, preserving semantic
intent and supporting fast, reactive control. A hybrid causal
transformer-diffusion motion generator further ensures long-horizon consistency
while maintaining stability and diversity, yielding rich latent representations
for precise humanoid behavior. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoboGhost
substantially reduces deployment latency, improves success rates and tracking
accuracy, and produces smooth, semantically aligned locomotion on real
humanoids. Beyond text, the framework naturally extends to other modalities
such as images, audio, and music, providing a general foundation for
vision-language-action humanoid systems.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CBF-RL框架通过在训练中强制执行控制屏障函数(CBFs)，将安全约束内化到强化学习策略中，无需在线安全过滤器即可实现安全部署。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习(RL)往往以牺牲安全性为代价追求性能，而安全违规在现实部署中可能导致灾难性后果。现有方法使用在线安全过滤器强制执行CBFs，但RL策略不了解CBF会导致保守行为。

Method: CBF-RL框架有两个关键属性：(1)通过CBF项最小化修改名义RL策略以编码安全约束；(2)在训练中对策略rollouts进行安全过滤。理论上证明了连续时间安全过滤器可以通过闭式表达式在离散时间rollouts上部署。

Result: CBF-RL使学习策略内化了安全约束，既强制执行更安全的动作，又偏向更安全的奖励。在导航任务和Unitree G1人形机器人上的实验表明，该方法实现了更安全的探索、更快的收敛和鲁棒性能。

Conclusion: CBF-RL框架能够在无需运行时安全过滤器的情况下，在真实世界环境中实现安全部署，使人形机器人能够安全避开障碍物和爬楼梯。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often
prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead
to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions
(CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally
deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior,
the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to
conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating
safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key
attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety
constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in
training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be
deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically,
we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned
policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards --
enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We
validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the
Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster
convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid
robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without
a runtime safety filter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的分层视觉-语言-动作框架使用VLM规划器将复杂任务分解为子任务，但微调VLM需要人工标注或启发式规则分解演示。启发式子任务可能与低级视觉运动策略的训练数据显著偏离，从而降低任务性能。

Method: 提出基于检索的演示分解器(RDD)，通过将分解的子任务间隔的视觉特征与低级视觉运动策略的训练数据对齐，自动将演示分解为子任务。

Result: 在仿真和真实世界任务中均优于最先进的子任务分解器，在不同设置下表现出鲁棒性。

Conclusion: RDD方法能够有效解决子任务分解与低级策略训练数据不匹配的问题，提高分层VLA框架的任务性能。

Abstract: To tackle long-horizon tasks, recent hierarchical vision-language-action
(VLAs) frameworks employ vision-language model (VLM)-based planners to
decompose complex manipulation tasks into simpler sub-tasks that low-level
visuomotor policies can easily handle. Typically, the VLM planner is finetuned
to learn to decompose a target task. This finetuning requires target task
demonstrations segmented into sub-tasks by either human annotation or heuristic
rules. However, the heuristic subtasks can deviate significantly from the
training data of the visuomotor policy, which degrades task performance. To
address these issues, we propose a Retrieval-based Demonstration Decomposer
(RDD) that automatically decomposes demonstrations into sub-tasks by aligning
the visual features of the decomposed sub-task intervals with those from the
training data of the low-level visuomotor policies. Our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art sub-task decomposer on both simulation and real-world tasks,
demonstrating robustness across diverse settings. Code and more results are
available at rdd-neurips.github.io.
