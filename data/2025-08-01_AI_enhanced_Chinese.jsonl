To accurately reconstruct object contours, it is\ncrucial for the whisker sensor to continuously follow and maintain an\nappropriate relative touch pose on the surface. This is especially important\nfor localization based on tip contact, which has a low tolerance for sharp\nsurfaces and must avoid slipping into tangential contact. In this paper, we\nfirst construct a magnetically transduced whisker sensor featuring a compact\nand robust suspension system composed of three flexible spiral arms.

We then propose an active motion control policy\nto maintain the optimal relative pose of the whisker sensor against the object\nsurface. A B-Spline curve is employed to predict the local surface curvature\nand determine the sensor orientation.

Recent\nrobotic foundation models often pre-train on cross-embodiment robot datasets to\nincrease data scale, while they face significant limitations as the diverse\nmorphologies and action spaces across different robot embodiments make unified\ntraining challenging. In this paper, we present H-RDT (Human to Robotics\nDiffusion Transformer), a novel approach that leverages human manipulation data\nto enhance robot manipulation capabilities. Our key insight is that large-scale\negocentric human manipulation videos with paired 3D hand pose annotations\nprovide rich behavioral priors that capture natural manipulation strategies and\ncan benefit robotic policy learning. We introduce a two-stage training\nparadigm: (1) pre-training on large-scale egocentric human manipulation data,\nand (2) cross-embodiment fine-tuning on robot-specific data with modular action\nencoders and decoders. Built on a diffusion transformer architecture with 2B\nparameters, H-RDT uses flow matching to model complex action distributions.\nExtensive evaluations encompassing both simulation and real-world experiments,\nsingle-task and multitask scenarios, as well as few-shot learning and\nrobustness assessments, demonstrate that H-RDT outperforms training from\nscratch and existing state-of-the-art methods, including Pi0 and RDT, achieving\nsignificant improvements of 13.9% and 40.5% over training from scratch in\nsimulation and real-world experiments, respectively.

A\nprimary challenge in RL models is their tendency to overfit specific tasks or\nenvironments, thereby hindering the acquisition of generalizable behaviors\nacross diverse settings. This paper provides a preliminary answer to this\nchallenge by demonstrating that RL-finetuned visuomotor agents in Minecraft can\nachieve zero-shot generalization to unseen worlds. Specifically, we explore\nRL's potential to enhance generalizable spatial reasoning and interaction\ncapabilities in 3D worlds. To address challenges in multi-task RL\nrepresentation, we analyze and establish cross-view goal specification as a\nunified multi-task goal space for visuomotor policies. Furthermore, to overcome\nthe significant bottleneck of manual task design, we propose automated task\nsynthesis within the highly customizable Minecraft environment for large-scale\nmulti-task RL training, and we construct an efficient distributed RL framework\nto support this. Experimental results show RL significantly boosts interaction\nsuccess rates by $4\\times$ and enables zero-shot generalization of spatial\nreasoning across diverse environments, including real-world settings.
