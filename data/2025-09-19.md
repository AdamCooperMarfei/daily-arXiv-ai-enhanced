Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: AEGIS是一个自动化错误生成和识别框架，通过向成功的多智能体系统轨迹中注入可控错误来创建大规模错误数据集，显著提升了错误识别模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体系统日益复杂，但缺乏大规模、多样化的错误标注数据集，严重阻碍了系统可靠性和安全性研究。

Method: 使用基于LLM的上下文感知自适应操纵器，通过提示注入和响应破坏等复杂攻击方式，在成功轨迹中注入可控、可追踪的错误，创建真实失败数据集。

Result: 在监督微调、强化学习和对比学习三种范式下，使用AEGIS数据训练的模型都取得了显著性能提升，部分微调模型性能甚至优于大一个数量级的专有系统。

Conclusion: AEGIS框架为开发更鲁棒和可解释的多智能体系统提供了关键的数据资源，自动化数据生成方法被证明是有效的。

Abstract: As Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) become increasingly autonomous and complex,
understanding their error modes is critical for ensuring their reliability and
safety. However, research in this area has been severely hampered by the lack
of large-scale, diverse datasets with precise, ground-truth error labels. To
address this bottleneck, we introduce \textbf{AEGIS}, a novel framework for
\textbf{A}utomated \textbf{E}rror \textbf{G}eneration and
\textbf{I}dentification for Multi-Agent \textbf{S}ystems. By systematically
injecting controllable and traceable errors into initially successful
trajectories, we create a rich dataset of realistic failures. This is achieved
using a context-aware, LLM-based adaptive manipulator that performs
sophisticated attacks like prompt injection and response corruption to induce
specific, predefined error modes. We demonstrate the value of our dataset by
exploring three distinct learning paradigms for the error identification task:
Supervised Fine-Tuning, Reinforcement Learning, and Contrastive Learning. Our
comprehensive experiments show that models trained on AEGIS data achieve
substantial improvements across all three learning paradigms. Notably, several
of our fine-tuned models demonstrate performance competitive with or superior
to proprietary systems an order of magnitude larger, validating our automated
data generation framework as a crucial resource for developing more robust and
interpretable multi-agent systems. Our project website is available at

### [2] [FlowDrive: Energy Flow Field for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14303)
*Hao Jiang,Zhipeng Zhang,Yu Gao,Zhigang Sun,Yiru Wang,Yuwen Heng,Shuo Wang,Jinhao Chai,Zhuo Chen,Hao Zhao,Hao Sun,Xi Zhang,Anqing Jiang,Chuan Hu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: FlowDrive是一个端到端自动驾驶框架，通过引入物理可解释的能量流场（风险势场和车道吸引场）来编码语义先验和安全提示，提升运动规划的安全性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有端到端自动驾驶框架通常依赖隐式学习的BEV特征，缺乏对风险和引导先验的显式建模，无法实现安全和可解释的规划。

Method: 提出FlowDrive框架，引入物理可解释的能量流场（风险势场和车道吸引场）编码语义先验；采用条件扩散规划器，通过特征级门控将运动意图预测与轨迹去噪解耦。

Result: 在NAVSIM v2基准测试中达到86.3的EPDMS分数，在安全性和规划质量方面均超越先前基线方法。

Conclusion: FlowDrive通过显式建模风险势场和车道吸引场，实现了更安全、可解释的自动驾驶运动规划，同时通过解耦设计提升了多模态轨迹生成的多样性。

Abstract: Recent advances in end-to-end autonomous driving leverage multi-view images
to construct BEV representations for motion planning. In motion planning,
autonomous vehicles need considering both hard constraints imposed by
geometrically occupied obstacles (e.g., vehicles, pedestrians) and soft,
rule-based semantics with no explicit geometry (e.g., lane boundaries, traffic
priors). However, existing end-to-end frameworks typically rely on BEV features
learned in an implicit manner, lacking explicit modeling of risk and guidance
priors for safe and interpretable planning. To address this, we propose
FlowDrive, a novel framework that introduces physically interpretable
energy-based flow fields-including risk potential and lane attraction fields-to
encode semantic priors and safety cues into the BEV space. These flow-aware
features enable adaptive refinement of anchor trajectories and serve as
interpretable guidance for trajectory generation. Moreover, FlowDrive decouples
motion intent prediction from trajectory denoising via a conditional diffusion
planner with feature-level gating, alleviating task interference and enhancing
multimodal diversity. Experiments on the NAVSIM v2 benchmark demonstrate that
FlowDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance with an EPDMS of 86.3,
surpassing prior baselines in both safety and planning quality. The project is
available at https://astrixdrive.github.io/FlowDrive.github.io/.

### [3] [Multi-Quadruped Cooperative Object Transport: Learning Decentralized Pinch-Lift-Move](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14342)
*Bikram Pandit,Aayam Kumar Shrestha,Alan Fern*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种去中心化多机器人协同运输方法，使用带机械臂的四足机器人团队通过纯接触力来夹持、提升和移动无法抓握的物体，无需通信或集中控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机械独立的机器人仅通过接触力进行协调的挑战性场景，而不依赖刚性的机械耦合或通信。

Method: 采用分层策略架构分离基座运动和臂控制，提出星座奖励公式统一位置和姿态跟踪以强制执行刚性接触行为，通过精心设计的奖励和训练课程使机器人表现得如同刚性地连接到物体。

Result: 在仿真实验中展示了2-10个机器人在不同物体几何形状和质量下的鲁棒运输能力，并实现了对轻量级物体的仿真到现实迁移。

Conclusion: 该方法通过共享策略参数和隐式同步线索实现协调，可扩展到任意团队规模而无需重新训练，为去中心化协同运输提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study decentralized cooperative transport using teams of N-quadruped
robots with arm that must pinch, lift, and move ungraspable objects through
physical contact alone. Unlike prior work that relies on rigid mechanical
coupling between robots and objects, we address the more challenging setting
where mechanically independent robots must coordinate through contact forces
alone without any communication or centralized control. To this end, we employ
a hierarchical policy architecture that separates base locomotion from arm
control, and propose a constellation reward formulation that unifies position
and orientation tracking to enforce rigid contact behavior. The key insight is
encouraging robots to behave as if rigidly connected to the object through
careful reward design and training curriculum rather than explicit mechanical
constraints. Our approach enables coordination through shared policy parameters
and implicit synchronization cues - scaling to arbitrary team sizes without
retraining. We show extensive simulation experiments to demonstrate robust
transport across 2-10 robots on diverse object geometries and masses, along
with sim2real transfer results on lightweight objects.

Abstract: We introduce LeVR, a modular software framework designed to bridge two
critical gaps in robotic imitation learning. First, it provides robust and
intuitive virtual reality (VR) teleoperation for data collection using robot
arms paired with dexterous hands, addressing a common limitation in existing
systems. Second, it natively integrates with the powerful LeRobot imitation
learning (IL) framework, enabling the use of VR-based teleoperation data and
streamlining the demonstration collection process. To demonstrate LeVR, we
release LeFranX, an open-source implementation for the Franka FER arm and
RobotEra XHand, two widely used research platforms. LeFranX delivers a
seamless, end-to-end workflow from data collection to real-world policy
deployment. We validate our system by collecting a public dataset of 100 expert
demonstrations and use it to successfully fine-tune state-of-the-art visuomotor
policies. We provide our open-source framework, implementation, and dataset to
accelerate IL research for the robotics community.

### [5] [DreamControl: Human-Inspired Whole-Body Humanoid Control for Scene Interaction via Guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14353)
*Dvij Kalaria,Sudarshan S Harithas,Pushkal Katara,Sangkyung Kwak,Sarthak Bhagat,Shankar Sastry,Srinath Sridhar,Sai Vemprala,Ashish Kapoor,Jonathan Chung-Kuan Huang*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: DreamControl是一种结合扩散模型和强化学习的新方法，利用人类运动数据的扩散先验来指导RL策略学习人形机器人全身控制技能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人形机器人同时控制上下半身并与物体交互的复杂任务，通过人类运动数据引导RL学习更自然和有效的运动策略

Method: 使用在人类运动数据上训练的扩散模型作为先验，在仿真中指导强化学习策略完成特定任务（如开抽屉、抓取物体）

Result: 该方法能够发现直接RL无法获得的解决方案，扩散模型自然促进动作的自然性，有助于仿真到现实的迁移，在Unitree G1机器人上验证了有效性

Conclusion: DreamControl通过结合扩散先验和RL，为人形机器人学习复杂的全身控制技能提供了一种有效的方法，特别是在需要自然动作和物体交互的任务中

Abstract: We introduce DreamControl, a novel methodology for learning autonomous
whole-body humanoid skills. DreamControl leverages the strengths of diffusion
models and Reinforcement Learning (RL): our core innovation is the use of a
diffusion prior trained on human motion data, which subsequently guides an RL
policy in simulation to complete specific tasks of interest (e.g., opening a
drawer or picking up an object). We demonstrate that this human motion-informed
prior allows RL to discover solutions unattainable by direct RL, and that
diffusion models inherently promote natural looking motions, aiding in
sim-to-real transfer. We validate DreamControl's effectiveness on a Unitree G1
robot across a diverse set of challenging tasks involving simultaneous lower
and upper body control and object interaction.

### [6] [CRAFT: Coaching Reinforcement Learning Autonomously using Foundation Models for Multi-Robot Coordination Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14380)
*Seoyeon Choi,Kanghyun Ryu,Jonghoon Ock,Negar Mehr*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CRAFT是一个利用基础模型作为"教练"的多机器人协调框架，通过LLM自动分解长时程任务为子任务序列，使用LLM生成奖励函数，并通过VLM指导的奖励精炼循环来训练多智能体强化学习系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习在机器人应用中面临高维连续动作空间、复杂奖励设计和非平稳转换等挑战，而人类通过分阶段课程学习复杂协调行为，这启发了利用基础模型作为教练的框架设计。

Method: 使用大型语言模型(LLM)自动分解长时程协调任务为子任务序列，通过LLM生成每个子任务的奖励函数，并利用视觉语言模型(VLM)进行奖励精炼循环来训练多智能体强化学习系统。

Result: 在四足机器人导航和双手操作任务上验证了CRAFT学习复杂协调行为的能力，并在真实硬件实验中验证了多四足机器人导航策略的有效性。

Conclusion: CRAFT框架成功利用基础模型的推理能力来解决多机器人协调任务中的挑战，为复杂多智能体协调学习提供了一种有效的自动化方法。

Abstract: Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) provides a powerful framework for
learning coordination in multi-agent systems. However, applying MARL to
robotics still remains challenging due to high-dimensional continuous joint
action spaces, complex reward design, and non-stationary transitions inherent
to decentralized settings. On the other hand, humans learn complex coordination
through staged curricula, where long-horizon behaviors are progressively built
upon simpler skills. Motivated by this, we propose CRAFT: Coaching
Reinforcement learning Autonomously using Foundation models for multi-robot
coordination Tasks, a framework that leverages the reasoning capabilities of
foundation models to act as a "coach" for multi-robot coordination. CRAFT
automatically decomposes long-horizon coordination tasks into sequences of
subtasks using the planning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs). In what
follows, CRAFT trains each subtask using reward functions generated by LLM, and
refines them through a Vision Language Model (VLM)-guided reward-refinement
loop. We evaluate CRAFT on multi-quadruped navigation and bimanual manipulation
tasks, demonstrating its capability to learn complex coordination behaviors. In
addition, we validate the multi-quadruped navigation policy in real hardware
experiments.

### [7] [RLBind: Adversarial-Invariant Cross-Modal Alignment for Unified Robust Embeddings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14383)
*Yuhong Lu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RLBind是一个两阶段对抗不变性跨模态对齐框架，通过无监督微调强化视觉编码器，并利用跨模态对应关系最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异，同时强制跨模态的类间分布对齐，显著提升了多模态编码器的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人部署中视觉分支面临对抗性和自然损坏，现有防御方法通常在CLIP风格编码器中对齐干净和对抗特征，但忽视了更广泛的跨模态对应关系，导致增益有限且往往损害零样本迁移能力。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段对干净-对抗对进行无监督微调以强化视觉编码器；第二阶段通过最小化干净/对抗特征与文本锚点之间的差异来利用跨模态对应关系，同时强制跨模态的类间分布对齐。

Result: 在图像、音频、热成像和视频数据上的广泛实验表明，RLBind在干净准确性和规范有界对抗鲁棒性方面始终优于LanguageBind主干和标准微调基线。

Conclusion: RLBind在不牺牲泛化能力的情况下提高了弹性，为具身机器人在导航、操作和其他自主设置中提供了更安全的多传感器感知堆栈的实用路径。

Abstract: Unified multi-modal encoders that bind vision, audio, and other sensors into
a shared embedding space are attractive building blocks for robot perception
and decision-making. However, on-robot deployment exposes the vision branch to
adversarial and natural corruptions, making robustness a prerequisite for
safety. Prior defenses typically align clean and adversarial features within
CLIP-style encoders and overlook broader cross-modal correspondence, yielding
modest gains and often degrading zero-shot transfer. We introduce RLBind, a
two-stage adversarial-invariant cross-modal alignment framework for robust
unified embeddings. Stage 1 performs unsupervised fine-tuning on
clean-adversarial pairs to harden the visual encoder. Stage 2 leverages
cross-modal correspondence by minimizing the discrepancy between
clean/adversarial features and a text anchor, while enforcing class-wise
distributional alignment across modalities. Extensive experiments on Image,
Audio, Thermal, and Video data show that RLBind consistently outperforms the
LanguageBind backbone and standard fine-tuning baselines in both clean accuracy
and norm-bounded adversarial robustness. By improving resilience without
sacrificing generalization, RLBind provides a practical path toward safer
multi-sensor perception stacks for embodied robots in navigation, manipulation,
and other autonomy settings.

### [8] [GestOS: Advanced Hand Gesture Interpretation via Large Language Models to control Any Type of Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14412)
*Artem Lykov,Oleg Kobzarev,Dzmitry Tsetserukou*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GestOS是一个基于手势的操作系统，通过语义理解和LLM推理实现异构机器人团队的智能任务分配与控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手势控制系统通常将手势映射为固定命令或单智能体动作，缺乏对异构机器人团队的动态任务分配和语义理解能力

Method: 结合轻量级视觉感知和大型语言模型(LLM)推理：将手势姿态转换为结构化文本描述，LLM推断意图并生成机器人特定命令，实时匹配最适合的机器人执行任务

Result: 实现了无需用户显式指定目标或命令的上下文感知自适应控制，支持在动态环境中与机器人系统的可扩展、灵活和用户友好的协作

Conclusion: GestOS将手势交互从识别推进到智能编排，为异构机器人团队提供了语义化、动态分配的高层控制系统

Abstract: We present GestOS, a gesture-based operating system for high-level control of
heterogeneous robot teams. Unlike prior systems that map gestures to fixed
commands or single-agent actions, GestOS interprets hand gestures semantically
and dynamically distributes tasks across multiple robots based on their
capabilities, current state, and supported instruction sets. The system
combines lightweight visual perception with large language model (LLM)
reasoning: hand poses are converted into structured textual descriptions, which
the LLM uses to infer intent and generate robot-specific commands. A robot
selection module ensures that each gesture-triggered task is matched to the
most suitable agent in real time. This architecture enables context-aware,
adaptive control without requiring explicit user specification of targets or
commands. By advancing gesture interaction from recognition to intelligent
orchestration, GestOS supports scalable, flexible, and user-friendly
collaboration with robotic systems in dynamic environments.

### [9] [Perception-Integrated Safety Critical Control via Analytic Collision Cone Barrier Functions on 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14421)
*Dario Tscholl,Yashwanth Nakka,Brian Gunter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于3D高斯拷贝的矩阵矩阵制造冲突凸函数，通过二次规划实现主动安全避障，计算效率高且可应用于实时导航。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统距离基于CBF方法反应性强、计算成本高的问题，通过3DGS的分析几何特性实现更主动、更平滑的安全避障。

Method: 将每个3D高斯拷贝转换为闭式前向冲突凸，构建一阶控制障碍凸函数(CBF)，嵌入二次规划(QP)求解。利用Minkowski和扩展处理机器人物理尺寸。

Result: 在包含17万个拷贝的大场景中，计划时间减少3倍，轨迹悬度显著降低，同时保持相同的安全性。

Conclusion: 该方法为实时导航提供了一种计算高效、主动预阻的安全过滤器，特别适用于空间机器人和卫星系统等极端环境。

Abstract: We present a perception-driven safety filter that converts each 3D Gaussian
Splat (3DGS) into a closed-form forward collision cone, which in turn yields a
first-order control barrier function (CBF) embedded within a quadratic program
(QP). By exploiting the analytic geometry of splats, our formulation provides a
continuous, closed-form representation of collision constraints that is both
simple and computationally efficient. Unlike distance-based CBFs, which tend to
activate reactively only when an obstacle is already close, our collision-cone
CBF activates proactively, allowing the robot to adjust earlier and thereby
produce smoother and safer avoidance maneuvers at lower computational cost. We
validate the method on a large synthetic scene with approximately 170k splats,
where our filter reduces planning time by a factor of 3 and significantly
decreased trajectory jerk compared to a state-of-the-art 3DGS planner, while
maintaining the same level of safety. The approach is entirely analytic,
requires no high-order CBF extensions (HOCBFs), and generalizes naturally to
robots with physical extent through a principled Minkowski-sum inflation of the
splats. These properties make the method broadly applicable to real-time
navigation in cluttered, perception-derived extreme environments, including
space robotics and satellite systems.

*Keqin Wang,Tao Zhong,David Chang,Christine Allen-Blanchette*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了LEGO框架，通过图神经网络实现多智能体强化学习的排列等变性和E(n)-等变性，解决了竞争环境中训练不稳定、非动能对策失效和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体强化学习在复杂决策中面临训练不稳定、对策失效和泛化能力差的挑战，特别是在竞争性场景如追逃任务中。

Method: LEGO框架结合图神经网络捕捉排列等变性和智能体数量泛化，通过规范化实现E(n)-等变性，使用异构表示编码角色特定的归纳偏置，可与MAPPO等流行MARL算法无缝集成。

Result: 在合作和竞争群体基准测试中，LEGO优于强基线并提高了泛化能力。真实世界实验显示其对团队规模变化和智能体故障具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LEGO框架有效解决了多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战，提供了更好的训练稳定性、对策有效性和泛化性能。

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm
for coordinating swarms of agents in complex decision-making, yet major
challenges remain. In competitive settings such as pursuer-evader tasks,
simultaneous adaptation can destabilize training; non-kinetic countermeasures
often fail under adverse conditions; and policies trained in one configuration
rarely generalize to environments with a different number of agents. To address
these issues, we propose the Local-Canonicalization Equivariant Graph Neural
Networks (LEGO) framework, which integrates seamlessly with popular MARL
algorithms such as MAPPO. LEGO employs graph neural networks to capture
permutation equivariance and generalization to different agent numbers,
canonicalization to enforce E(n)-equivariance, and heterogeneous
representations to encode role-specific inductive biases. Experiments on
cooperative and competitive swarm benchmarks show that LEGO outperforms strong
baselines and improves generalization. In real-world experiments, LEGO
demonstrates robustness to varying team sizes and agent failure.

### [11] [Online Learning of Deceptive Policies under Intermittent Observation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14453)
*Gokul Puthumanaillam,Ram Padmanabhan,Jose Fuentes,Nicole Cruz,Paulo Padrao,Ruben Hernandez,Hao Jiang,William Schafer,Leonardo Bobadilla,Melkior Ornik*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 该论文研究在间歇性监控环境下，智能体如何通过心理理论(Theory of Mind)实现欺骗性行为，在追求私有目标的同时保持对监督者参考策略的表面合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中自主系统的监控往往是间歇性而非连续的，智能体需要在监控间隙追求私有目标，同时在可能被观察时保持合规表象。受人类监督者行为启发，研究如何利用心理理论来指导强化学习实现这种欺骗性行为。

Method: 通过建模监督者的期望，提取一个标量指标——预期偏差证据，该指标结合了参考策略与当前动作分布的差异程度以及智能体对即将被观察的信念。将该标量作为状态依赖权重注入到KL正则化的策略改进步骤中，实现在线强化学习。

Result: 在海洋(ASV)和空中(UAV)导航的真实硬件实验中，ToM引导的强化学习方法能够在线运行，实现高回报和成功率，同时观察轨迹证据与监督者期望相校准。

Conclusion: 心理理论可以有效地重新用于指导在线强化学习产生欺骗性行为，通过单一校准标量平滑地权衡自利性和合规性，避免了手工或启发式策略的设计。

Abstract: In supervisory control settings, autonomous systems are not monitored
continuously. Instead, monitoring often occurs at sporadic intervals within
known bounds. We study the problem of deception, where an agent pursues a
private objective while remaining plausibly compliant with a supervisor's
reference policy when observations occur. Motivated by the behavior of real,
human supervisors, we situate the problem within Theory of Mind: the
representation of what an observer believes and expects to see. We show that
Theory of Mind can be repurposed to steer online reinforcement learning (RL)
toward such deceptive behavior. We model the supervisor's expectations and
distill from them a single, calibrated scalar -- the expected evidence of
deviation if an observation were to happen now. This scalar combines how unlike
the reference and current action distributions appear, with the agent's belief
that an observation is imminent. Injected as a state-dependent weight into a
KL-regularized policy improvement step within an online RL loop, this scalar
informs a closed-form update that smoothly trades off self-interest and
compliance, thus sidestepping hand-crafted or heuristic policies. In
real-world, real-time hardware experiments on marine (ASV) and aerial (UAV)
navigation, our ToM-guided RL runs online, achieves high return and success
with observed-trace evidence calibrated to the supervisor's expectations.

### [12] [Learning Discrete Abstractions for Visual Rearrangement Tasks Using Vision-Guided Graph Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14460)
*Abhiroop Ajith,Constantinos Chamzas*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种从视觉数据自动发现离散图结构抽象的方法，用于机器人重排任务规划，结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，无需人工设计抽象


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类能够自然地在抽象层面进行推理，而机器人中的抽象通常需要人工设计，限制了可扩展性和实际应用。需要从视觉数据自动发现有用的抽象来支持高层规划

Method: 结合结构约束和注意力引导的视觉距离，利用重排问题固有的二分图结构，将结构约束和视觉嵌入整合到统一框架中，从纯视觉数据自主发现抽象

Result: 在仿真中的两个重排任务上评估，方法能够一致地识别出有意义的抽象，支持有效规划，并优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够从视觉数据自动发现有用的抽象，为机器人高层规划提供了可扩展的解决方案，在复杂环境中实现了高效的抽象推理

Abstract: Learning abstractions directly from data is a core challenge in robotics.
Humans naturally operate at an abstract level, reasoning over high-level
subgoals while delegating execution to low-level motor skills -- an ability
that enables efficient problem solving in complex environments. In robotics,
abstractions and hierarchical reasoning have long been central to planning, yet
they are typically hand-engineered, demanding significant human effort and
limiting scalability. Automating the discovery of useful abstractions directly
from visual data would make planning frameworks more scalable and more
applicable to real-world robotic domains. In this work, we focus on
rearrangement tasks where the state is represented with raw images, and propose
a method to induce discrete, graph-structured abstractions by combining
structural constraints with an attention-guided visual distance. Our approach
leverages the inherent bipartite structure of rearrangement problems,
integrating structural constraints and visual embeddings into a unified
framework. This enables the autonomous discovery of abstractions from vision
alone, which can subsequently support high-level planning. We evaluate our
method on two rearrangement tasks in simulation and show that it consistently
identifies meaningful abstractions that facilitate effective planning and
outperform existing approaches.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了GelSight Baby Fin Ray软体机器人手在触觉感知方面的进展，利用机器学习技术进行纹理识别、力与位置估计的研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 进一步探索GelSight Baby Fin Ray软体机器人手的潜力，通过机器学习从高分辨率触觉图像中提取有用信息，增强软体机器人对环境理解和交互的能力。

Method: 采用消融研究，比较了ResNet50、GoogLeNet以及3层和5层卷积神经网络(CNN)结构，用于纹理识别和力/位置估计任务。

Result: 研究表明基于相机的触觉感知能够捕获丰富的接触信息（力、物体几何形状和纹理），机器学习技术能够有效提取这些信息。

Conclusion: 机器学习是从高分辨率触觉图像中提取有用信息的有前景技术，能够赋能软体机器人更好地理解和与环境互动。

Abstract: Recent advances in soft robotic hands and tactile sensing have enabled both
to perform an increasing number of complex tasks with the aid of machine
learning. In particular, we presented the GelSight Baby Fin Ray in our previous
work, which integrates a camera with a soft, compliant Fin Ray structure.
Camera-based tactile sensing gives the GelSight Baby Fin Ray the ability to
capture rich contact information like forces, object geometries, and textures.
Moreover, our previous work showed that the GelSight Baby Fin Ray can dig
through clutter, and classify in-shell nuts. To further examine the potential
of the GelSight Baby Fin Ray, we leverage learning to distinguish nut-in-shell
textures and to perform force and position estimation. We implement ablation
studies with popular neural network structures, including ResNet50, GoogLeNet,
and 3- and 5-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. We conclude
that machine learning is a promising technique to extract useful information
from high-resolution tactile images and empower soft robotics to better
understand and interact with the environments.

*Adam D. Hines,Alejandro Fontan,Michael Milford,Tobias Fischer*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Event-LAB是一个统一框架，用于在多个数据集上运行事件相机定位方法，解决了该领域代码依赖和数据格式多样化带来的比较困难问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机定位研究快速发展，但不同方法的代码依赖和数据格式差异导致比较困难，研究人员难以可靠实现不同方法的对比。

Method: 使用Pixi包管理器实现单命令行安装和调用，支持多种定位方法和数据集组合，实现了视觉位置识别(VPR)和同步定位与建图(SLAM)两种常见管道。

Conclusion: Event-LAB为研究社区提供了简化工作流，能够轻松设置多种条件进行公平比较，解决了事件相机定位领域的标准化问题。

Abstract: Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of
interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published
papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the
field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the
variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats,
making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement
reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified
framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across
multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and
dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and
invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To
demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common
event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the

TL;DR: 基于人类示范学习的草莓采摘机器人系统，通过修改的ACT算法有效解决遮挡草莓的精细操作挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 草莓自然生长在聚集中，常被叶子和枝条遮挡，传统机器人系统难以精确采摘遮挡的果实

Method: 使用4-DoF SCARA机械臂配合人类远程操控界面收集数据，采用终点位置辅助的动作切块Transformer(ACT)算法学习细粒度视觉运动控制策略

Result: 在多种遮挡场景下的实验表明，修改后的方法显著超过直接实施ACT的性能

Conclusion: 该系统通过人类示范学习有效解决了遮挡草莓的精细操作问题，具有实际应用潜力

Abstract: Strawberries naturally grow in clusters, interwoven with leaves, stems, and
other fruits, which frequently leads to occlusion. This inherent growth habit
presents a significant challenge for robotic picking, as traditional
percept-plan-control systems struggle to reach fruits amid the clutter.
Effectively picking an occluded strawberry demands dexterous manipulation to
carefully bypass or gently move the surrounding soft objects and precisely
access the ideal picking point located at the stem just above the calyx. To
address this challenge, we introduce a strawberry-picking robotic system that
learns from human demonstrations. Our system features a 4-DoF SCARA arm paired
with a human teleoperation interface for efficient data collection and
leverages an End Pose Assisted Action Chunking Transformer (ACT) to develop a
fine-grained visuomotor picking policy. Experiments under various occlusion
scenarios demonstrate that our modified approach significantly outperforms the
direct implementation of ACT, underscoring its potential for practical
application in occluded strawberry picking.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of automating vibratory sieve shaker
operations in a materials laboratory, focusing on three critical tasks: 1)
dual-arm lid manipulation in 3 cm clearance spaces, 2) bimanual handover in
overlapping workspaces, and 3) obstructed powder sample container delivery with
orientation constraints. These tasks present significant challenges, including
inefficient sampling in narrow passages, the need for smooth trajectories to
prevent spillage, and suboptimal paths generated by conventional methods. To
overcome these challenges, we propose a hierarchical planning framework
combining Prior-Guided Path Planning and Multi-Step Trajectory Optimization.
The former uses a finite Gaussian mixture model to improve sampling efficiency
in narrow passages, while the latter refines paths by shortening, simplifying,
imposing joint constraints, and B-spline smoothing. Experimental results
demonstrate the framework's effectiveness: planning time is reduced by up to
80.4%, and waypoints are decreased by 89.4%. Furthermore, the system completes
the full vibratory sieve shaker operation workflow in a physical experiment,
validating its practical applicability for complex laboratory automation.

Abstract: Curated datasets are essential for training and evaluating AI approaches, but
are often lacking in domains where language and physical action are deeply
intertwined. In particular, few datasets capture how people acquire embodied
skills through verbal instruction over time. To address this gap, we introduce
SimCoachCorpus: a unique dataset of race car simulator driving that allows for
the investigation of rich interactive phenomena during guided and unguided
motor skill acquisition. In this dataset, 29 humans were asked to drive in a
simulator around a race track for approximately ninety minutes. Fifteen
participants were given personalized one-on-one instruction from a professional
performance driving coach, and 14 participants drove without coaching. \name\
includes embodied features such as vehicle state and inputs, map (track
boundaries and raceline), and cone landmarks. These are synchronized with
concurrent verbal coaching from a professional coach and additional feedback at
the end of each lap. We further provide annotations of coaching categories for
each concurrent feedback utterance, ratings on students' compliance with
coaching advice, and self-reported cognitive load and emotional state of
participants (gathered from surveys during the study). The dataset includes
over 20,000 concurrent feedback utterances, over 400 terminal feedback
utterances, and over 40 hours of vehicle driving data. Our naturalistic dataset
can be used for investigating motor learning dynamics, exploring linguistic
phenomena, and training computational models of teaching. We demonstrate
applications of this dataset for in-context learning, imitation learning, and
topic modeling. The dataset introduced in this work will be released publicly
upon publication of the peer-reviewed version of this paper. Researchers

Motivation: 可重构机器人系统需要适应目标结构进行配置和协调，但庞大复杂的搜索空间容易陷入局部最优，需要开发有效的规划方法

Method: 集成多机械臂和旋转台的可重构系统，采用分层优化方法：使用多目标遗传算法进行序列和任务规划（含运动评估），然后用约束规划进行调度，针对序列规划引入染色体初始化方法

Result: 仿真结果表明该方法能有效解决可重构机器人拆卸中的复杂问题

Conclusion: 提出的系统集成和分层优化方法能够为可重构机器人自动拆卸约束结构生成满足多重条件的可行计划

Abstract: This study presents a system integration approach for planning schedules,
sequences, tasks, and motions for reconfigurable robots to automatically
disassemble constrained structures in a non-destructive manner. Such systems
must adapt their configuration and coordination to the target structure, but
the large and complex search space makes them prone to local optima. To address
this, we integrate multiple robot arms equipped with different types of tools,
together with a rotary stage, into a reconfigurable setup. This flexible system
is based on a hierarchical optimization method that generates plans meeting
multiple preferred conditions under mandatory requirements within a realistic
timeframe. The approach employs two many-objective genetic algorithms for
sequence and task planning with motion evaluations, followed by constraint
programming for scheduling. Because sequence planning has a much larger search
space, we introduce a chromosome initialization method tailored to constrained
structures to mitigate the risk of local optima. Simulation results demonstrate
that the proposed method effectively solves complex problems in reconfigurable
robotic disassembly.

Method: 提出了一个框架：(1)建立具身等变性理论指导动作空间和策略设计；(2)引入强制配置等变性的动作解码器；(3)结合几何感知网络架构增强与具身无关的空间推理能力。

Conclusion: 通过等变性原理设计的动作空间和策略能够有效解决跨具身泛化问题，为机器人学习提供了新的理论框架和实践方法。

Abstract: Vision-language-action policies learn manipulation skills across tasks,
environments and embodiments through large-scale pre-training. However, their
ability to generalize to novel robot configurations remains limited. Most
approaches emphasize model size, dataset scale and diversity while paying less
attention to the design of action spaces. This leads to the configuration
generalization problem, which requires costly adaptation. We address this
challenge by formulating cross-embodiment pre-training as designing policies
equivariant to embodiment configuration transformations. Building on this
principle, we propose a framework that (i) establishes a embodiment
equivariance theory for action space and policy design, (ii) introduces an
action decoder that enforces configuration equivariance, and (iii) incorporates
a geometry-aware network architecture to enhance embodiment-agnostic spatial
reasoning. Extensive experiments in both simulation and real-world settings
demonstrate that our approach improves pre-training effectiveness and enables
efficient fine-tuning on novel robot embodiments. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: BEV-ODOM2是一个改进的单目视觉里程计框架，通过密集BEV光流监督和PV-BEV融合技术，解决了现有BEV方法的稀疏监督和信息丢失问题，在多个数据集上实现了40%的相对轨迹误差提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Bird's-Eye-View方法在单目视觉里程计中存在稀疏监督信号和透视到BEV投影过程中的信息丢失问题，需要在不增加额外标注的情况下解决这些限制。

Method: 提出密集BEV光流监督（从3-DoF位姿真值构建）和PV-BEV融合（在投影前计算相关体积以保留6-DoF运动线索），采用三级监督机制和增强的旋转采样策略。

Result: 在KITTI、NCLT、Oxford和新收集的ZJH-VO多尺度数据集上实现了最先进性能，相比之前的BEV方法在相对轨迹误差上提升了40%。

Conclusion: BEV-ODOM2有效解决了BEV方法的监督稀疏性和信息丢失问题，显著提升了单目视觉里程计的性能，并发布了覆盖多样化地面车辆场景的ZJH-VO数据集。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) representation offers a metric-scaled planar workspace,
facilitating the simplification of 6-DoF ego-motion to a more robust 3-DoF
model for monocular visual odometry (MVO) in intelligent transportation
systems. However, existing BEV methods suffer from sparse supervision signals
and information loss during perspective-to-BEV projection. We present
BEV-ODOM2, an enhanced framework addressing both limitations without additional
annotations. Our approach introduces: (1) dense BEV optical flow supervision
constructed from 3-DoF pose ground truth for pixel-level guidance; (2) PV-BEV
fusion that computes correlation volumes before projection to preserve 6-DoF
motion cues while maintaining scale consistency. The framework employs three
supervision levels derived solely from pose data: dense BEV flow, 5-DoF for the
PV branch, and final 3-DoF output. Enhanced rotation sampling further balances
diverse motion patterns in training. Extensive evaluation on KITTI, NCLT,
Oxford, and our newly collected ZJH-VO multi-scale dataset demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 40 improvement in RTE compared to
previous BEV methods. The ZJH-VO dataset, covering diverse ground vehicle
scenarios from underground parking to outdoor plazas, is publicly available to

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集3D卷积虽然准确但计算成本高，不适合实时机器人系统。现有三平面方法依赖于2D图像特征和隐式MLP，计算重。

Method: 新颖的无插值三平面提取和体积融合框架，直接将3D像素投影到平面特征，通过广播和求和重构特征体积。添加低分辨率体积分支获取全局上下文，通过轻量融合层结合。

Result: 在分类和补全任务中保持或提高准确性，在分割和检测任务中以较小的准确性下降换价换显著的计算节省。在NVIDIA Jetson Orin nano上实现了稳健的实时速率。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持高准确性的同时大幅提升了计算效率，适合嵌入式机器人知觉系统的实时处理需求。

Abstract: Dense 3D convolutions provide high accuracy for perception but are too
computationally expensive for real-time robotic systems. Existing tri-plane
methods rely on 2D image features with interpolation, point-wise queries, and
implicit MLPs, which makes them computationally heavy and unsuitable for
embedded 3D inference. As an alternative, we propose a novel interpolation-free
tri-plane lifting and volumetric fusion framework, that directly projects 3D
voxels into plane features and reconstructs a feature volume through broadcast
and summation. This shifts nonlinearity to 2D convolutions, reducing complexity
while remaining fully parallelizable. To capture global context, we add a
low-resolution volumetric branch fused with the lifted features through a
lightweight integration layer, yielding a design that is both efficient and
end-to-end GPU-accelerated. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed
method, we conduct experiments on classification, completion, segmentation, and
detection, and we map the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy across
tasks. Results show that classification and completion retain or improve
accuracy, while segmentation and detection trade modest drops in accuracy for
significant computational savings. On-device benchmarks on an NVIDIA Jetson
Orin nano confirm robust real-time throughput, demonstrating the suitability of
the approach for embedded robotic perception.

Abstract: The emerging field of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) for humanoid robots faces
several fundamental challenges, including the high cost of data acquisition,
the lack of a standardized benchmark, and the significant gap between
simulation and the real world. To overcome these obstacles, we propose
RealMirror, a comprehensive, open-source embodied AI VLA platform. RealMirror
builds an efficient, low-cost data collection, model training, and inference
system that enables end-to-end VLA research without requiring a real robot. To
facilitate model evolution and fair comparison, we also introduce a dedicated
VLA benchmark for humanoid robots, featuring multiple scenarios, extensive
trajectories, and various VLA models. Furthermore, by integrating generative
models and 3D Gaussian Splatting to reconstruct realistic environments and
robot models, we successfully demonstrate zero-shot Sim2Real transfer, where
models trained exclusively on simulation data can perform tasks on a real robot
seamlessly, without any fine-tuning. In conclusion, with the unification of
these critical components, RealMirror provides a robust framework that
significantly accelerates the development of VLA models for humanoid robots.

Motivation: 重新研究和深入分析Wohlhart提出的三环空间连杆机构，以明确其自由度特性和配置空间的形状，解决之前分析中存在的不确定性。

Method: 采用局部分析方法，计算运动学切向链接圆链和配置空间的局部近似，通过高阶微分分析确定机构的微分自由度和摇动性质。

Result: 证明该机构在参考配置下微分自由度为5度，但有限自由度为3度，属于过约束机构；配置空间局部为光滑流形，参考配置不是奇异点；微分自由度局部恒定，证明机构具有摇动性质。

Conclusion: 该三环空间连杆机构是一个过约束且摇动的机构，其参考配置不是配置空间奇异点，高阶局部分析有助于深入理解这类复杂机构的运动学特性。

Abstract: This paper revisits a three-loop spatial linkage that was proposed in an ARK
2004 paper by Karl Wohlhart (as extension of a two-loop linkage proposed by
Eddie Baker in 1980) and later analyzed in an ARK 2006 paper by Diez-Martinez
et. al. A local analysis shows that this linkage has a finite degree of freedom
(DOF) 3 (and is thus overconstrained) while in its reference configuration the
differential DOF is 5. It is shown that its configuration space is locally a
smooth manifold so that the reference configuration is not a c-space
singularity. It is shown that the differential DOF is locally constant, which
makes this linkage shaky (so that the reference configuration is not a
singularity). The higher-order local analysis is facilitated by the computation
of the kinematic tangent cone as well as a local approximation of the c-space.

Motivation: 传统基于模型的控制器依赖预计算参考轨迹，限制了性能。强化学习研究发现许多控制器优化的是替代目标（如轨迹跟踪）而非直接最大化通过门进度的主要竞速目标。

Method: 将源自RL奖励塑造的门进度目标直接整合到MPPI框架中，利用MPPI的采样特性实时优化不连续、不可微的目标函数，并与轨迹跟踪、轮廓控制进行系统对比。

Result: 提出的无参考方法实现了有竞争力的竞速性能，与基于参考的方法相当或更优，MPPI在优化不连续目标方面优于传统梯度求解器。

Conclusion: 参考自由的方法通过直接优化门进度目标，在无人机竞速中表现出色，为时间最优控制提供了新思路，MPPI框架为不同目标函数的公平比较提供了统一平台。

Abstract: While model-based controllers have demonstrated remarkable performance in
autonomous drone racing, their performance is often constrained by the reliance
on pre-computed reference trajectories. Conventional approaches, such as
trajectory tracking, demand a dynamically feasible, full-state reference,
whereas contouring control relaxes this requirement to a geometric path but
still necessitates a reference. Recent advancements in reinforcement learning
(RL) have revealed that many model-based controllers optimize surrogate
objectives, such as trajectory tracking, rather than the primary racing goal of
directly maximizing progress through gates. Inspired by these findings, this
work introduces a reference-free method for time-optimal racing by
incorporating this gate progress objective, derived from RL reward shaping,
directly into the Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) formulation. The
sampling-based nature of MPPI makes it uniquely capable of optimizing the
discontinuous and non-differentiable objective in real-time. We also establish
a unified framework that leverages MPPI to systematically and fairly compare
three distinct objective functions with a consistent dynamics model and
parameter set: classical trajectory tracking, contouring control, and the
proposed gate progress objective. We compare the performance of these three
objectives when solved via both MPPI and a traditional gradient-based solver.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed reference-free approach achieves
competitive racing performance, rivaling or exceeding reference-based methods.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了非语言沟通在人机协作中的影响，通过对比LED信号单独使用与结合情感显示的效果，发现情感显示虽能提升用户互动性但对任务性能改善有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在人机共享工作空间中，有效沟通对安全和效率至关重要。本文通过研究非语言沟通方式（光信号和情感显示）对人机交互的影响，以提升协作效果和安全性。

Method: 使用Franka Emika Panda机器人，在末端执行器上安装LED灯带，并通过平板显示动态面部表情。设计了三种沟通条件：LED信号单独、LED信号+反应式情感显示、LED信号+预先情感显示。进行了18名参与者的人机协作实验，通过问卷和位置跟踪收集数据。

Result: 结果显示，情感显示虽然提高了机器人的互动性感知，但与单独使用LED信号相比，并没有显著改善碰撞预期、沟通清晰度或任务效率。

Conclusion: 情感提示能够增强用户参与感，但在共享工作空间的任务性能方面效果有限。LED信号已经能够提供有效的沟通，情感显示的降级使用可能更加合适。

Abstract: Effective communication is essential for safety and efficiency in human-robot
collaboration, particularly in shared workspaces. This paper investigates the
impact of nonverbal communication on human-robot interaction (HRI) by
integrating reactive light signals and emotional displays into a robotic
system. We equipped a Franka Emika Panda robot with an LED strip on its end
effector and an animated facial display on a tablet to convey movement intent
through colour-coded signals and facial expressions. We conducted a human-robot
collaboration experiment with 18 participants, evaluating three conditions: LED
signals alone, LED signals with reactive emotional displays, and LED signals
with pre-emptive emotional displays. We collected data through questionnaires
and position tracking to assess anticipation of potential collisions, perceived
clarity of communication, and task performance. The results indicate that while
emotional displays increased the perceived interactivity of the robot, they did
not significantly improve collision anticipation, communication clarity, or
task efficiency compared to LED signals alone. These findings suggest that
while emotional cues can enhance user engagement, their impact on task
performance in shared workspaces is limited.

Abstract: Ensuring safety of vision-based control systems remains a major challenge
hindering their deployment in critical settings. Safety filters have gained
increased interest as effective tools for ensuring the safety of classical
control systems, but their applications in vision-based control settings have
so far been limited. Pre-trained vision models (PVRs) have been shown to be
effective perception backbones for control in various robotics domains. In this
paper, we are interested in examining their effectiveness when used for
designing vision-based safety filters. We use them as backbones for classifiers
defining failure sets, for Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based safety
filters, and for latent world models. We discuss the trade-offs between
training from scratch, fine-tuning, and freezing the PVRs when training the
models they are backbones for. We also evaluate whether one of the PVRs is
superior across all tasks, evaluate whether learned world models or Q-functions
are better for switching decisions to safe policies, and discuss practical
considerations for deploying these PVRs on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: Manipulation in confined and cluttered environments remains a significant
challenge due to partial observability and complex configuration spaces.
Effective manipulation in such environments requires an intelligent exploration
strategy to safely understand the scene and search the target. In this paper,
we propose COMPASS, a multi-stage exploration and manipulation framework
featuring a manipulation-aware sampling-based planner. First, we reduce
collision risks with a near-field awareness scan to build a local collision
map. Additionally, we employ a multi-objective utility function to find
viewpoints that are both informative and conducive to subsequent manipulation.
Moreover, we perform a constrained manipulation optimization strategy to
generate manipulation poses that respect obstacle constraints. To
systematically evaluate method's performance under these difficulties, we
propose a benchmark of confined-space exploration and manipulation containing
four level challenging scenarios. Compared to exploration methods designed for
other robots and only considering information gain, our framework increases
manipulation success rate by 24.25% in simulations. Real-world experiments

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: GCR-PPO是一种改进的actor-critic优化方法，通过多目标梯度分解和冲突解决机制，在机器人控制任务中相比传统PPO方法实现了9.5%的平均性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL控制器将多任务目标聚合为单一标量奖励，存在奖励调优困难、易陷入局部最优、可扩展性差等问题，特别是在任务目标与策略正则化项之间存在冲突时。

Method: 提出GCR-PPO方法：使用多头critic分解actor更新为目标梯度，基于目标优先级解决梯度冲突，改进了actor-critic优化过程。

Result: 在IsaacLab操作和运动基准测试中，GCR-PPO相比并行PPO表现出更好的可扩展性(p=0.04)，在高冲突任务中性能提升更显著，平均改进9.5%。

Conclusion: GCR-PPO通过显式处理多目标梯度冲突，有效解决了机器人RL控制中的奖励调优和局部最优问题，具有更好的可扩展性和性能表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task
objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy
optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot
locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning
and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the
number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their
trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain
underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation
difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient
contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task
objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between
task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic
behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that
decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed
critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology,
GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion
benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks.
We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without
significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more
conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average
improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

Motivation: 解决现有视觉-语言-动作(VLA)系统的关键限制，包括领域过拟合、不可解释的推理过程以及辅助生成模型的高延迟问题，使VLA从黑盒控制器转变为真正能与人类协作的智能助手。

Method: 采用混合专家设计，整合基于VLM的反思推理和基于扩散的动作生成，通过两阶段训练方法（动作接地和反思调优）实现显式自我反思，并在遇到不确定性或重复失败时主动寻求人类指导。

Result: 与生成式智能体相比，标准化时间减少约2倍，Dream计数减少约4倍，实现了更高的成功率、改进的可解释性以及平衡的低延迟性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作在将VLA从黑盒控制器转变为真正能够推理、行动并与人类协作的辅助智能体方面迈出了开创性的一步。

Abstract: In this work, we present CollabVLA, a self-reflective vision-language-action
framework that transforms a standard visuomotor policy into a collaborative
assistant. CollabVLA tackles key limitations of prior VLAs, including domain
overfitting, non-interpretable reasoning, and the high latency of auxiliary
generative models, by integrating VLM-based reflective reasoning with
diffusion-based action generation under a mixture-of-experts design. Through a
two-stage training recipe of action grounding and reflection tuning, it
supports explicit self-reflection and proactively solicits human guidance when
confronted with uncertainty or repeated failure. It cuts normalized Time by ~2x
and Dream counts by ~4x vs. generative agents, achieving higher success rates,
improved interpretability, and balanced low latency compared with existing
methods. This work takes a pioneering step toward shifting VLAs from opaque
controllers to genuinely assistive agents capable of reasoning, acting, and
collaborating with humans.

Motivation: 解决水平安装LiDAR在特征稀少环境中地面感知不足的问题，避免传统方案（静态倾斜、主动旋转或高密度传感器）带来的水平感知损失、额外执行器、成本和功耗

Method: 建立内部差速驱动与传感器姿态的耦合模型，在名义目标或轨迹跟踪命令上叠加有界非周期性振荡，实现被动LiDAR激励

Result: 在实验室、走廊和战术环境中验证，达到96%地图完整性，轨迹跟踪误差减少27%，实现鲁棒的近地面人体检测，重量、功耗和成本均低于基线方案

Conclusion: PERAL提供了一种无需专用硬件的感知感知运动控制解决方案，显著提升了LiDAR-IMU里程计在特征稀少环境中的性能，设计代码将开源

Abstract: Autonomous mobile robots increasingly rely on LiDAR-IMU odometry for
navigation and mapping, yet horizontally mounted LiDARs such as the MID360
capture few near-ground returns, limiting terrain awareness and degrading
performance in feature-scarce environments. Prior solutions - static tilt,
active rotation, or high-density sensors - either sacrifice horizontal
perception or incur added actuators, cost, and power. We introduce PERAL, a
perception-aware motion control framework for spherical robots that achieves
passive LiDAR excitation without dedicated hardware. By modeling the coupling
between internal differential-drive actuation and sensor attitude, PERAL
superimposes bounded, non-periodic oscillations onto nominal goal- or
trajectory-tracking commands, enriching vertical scan diversity while
preserving navigation accuracy. Implemented on a compact spherical robot, PERAL
is validated across laboratory, corridor, and tactical environments.
Experiments demonstrate up to 96 percent map completeness, a 27 percent
reduction in trajectory tracking error, and robust near-ground human detection,
all at lower weight, power, and cost compared with static tilt, active
rotation, and fixed horizontal baselines. The design and code will be
open-sourced upon acceptance.

Conclusion: RCS是一个轻量级但功能完整的生态系统，有效解决了机器人学习研究中传统软件框架的瓶颈问题，为大规模通用策略的研究提供了有力支持

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) mark a major shift in robot learning.
They replace specialized architectures and task-tailored components of expert
policies with large-scale data collection and setup-specific fine-tuning. In
this machine learning-focused workflow that is centered around models and
scalable training, traditional robotics software frameworks become a
bottleneck, while robot simulations offer only limited support for
transitioning from and to real-world experiments. In this work, we close this
gap by introducing Robot Control Stack (RCS), a lean ecosystem designed from
the ground up to support research in robot learning with large-scale generalist
policies. At its core, RCS features a modular and easily extensible layered
architecture with a unified interface for simulated and physical robots,
facilitating sim-to-real transfer. Despite its minimal footprint and
dependencies, it offers a complete feature set, enabling both real-world
experiments and large-scale training in simulation. Our contribution is
twofold: First, we introduce the architecture of RCS and explain its design
principles. Second, we evaluate its usability and performance along the
development cycle of VLA and RL policies. Our experiments also provide an
extensive evaluation of Octo, OpenVLA, and Pi Zero on multiple robots and shed
light on how simulation data can improve real-world policy performance. Our

Abstract: This paper presents a CAD-driven co-design framework for optimizing
jet-powered aerial humanoid robots to execute dynamically constrained
trajectories. Starting from the iRonCub-Mk3 model, a Design of Experiments
(DoE) approach is used to generate 5,000 geometrically varied and mechanically
feasible designs by modifying limb dimensions, jet interface geometry (e.g.,
angle and offset), and overall mass distribution. Each model is constructed
through CAD assemblies to ensure structural validity and compatibility with
simulation tools. To reduce computational cost and enable parameter sensitivity
analysis, the models are clustered using K-means, with representative centroids
selected for evaluation. A minimum-jerk trajectory is used to assess flight
performance, providing position and velocity references for a momentum-based
linearized Model Predictive Control (MPC) strategy. A multi-objective
optimization is then conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm, jointly exploring
the space of design centroids and MPC gain parameters. The objectives are to
minimize trajectory tracking error and mechanical energy expenditure. The
framework outputs a set of flight-ready humanoid configurations with validated
control parameters, offering a structured method for selecting and implementing
feasible aerial humanoid designs.

Abstract: Despite recent advances in dexterous manipulations, the manipulation of
articulated objects and generalization across different categories remain
significant challenges. To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel
framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and
linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency
and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART
leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify
optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these
interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an
optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the
limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline
reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results
demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation
ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness. For

Abstract: Efficient coordination of multiple robots for coverage of large, unknown
environments is a significant challenge that involves minimizing the total
coverage path length while reducing inter-robot conflicts. In this paper, we
introduce a Multi-robot Connectivity-Aware Planner (Multi-CAP), a hierarchical
coverage path planning algorithm that facilitates multi-robot coordination
through a novel connectivity-aware approach. The algorithm constructs and
dynamically maintains an adjacency graph that represents the environment as a
set of connected subareas. Critically, we make the assumption that the
environment, while unknown, is bounded. This allows for incremental refinement
of the adjacency graph online to ensure its structure represents the physical
layout of the space, both in observed and unobserved areas of the map as robots
explore the environment. We frame the task of assigning subareas to robots as a
Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), a well-studied problem for finding optimal
routes for a fleet of vehicles. This is used to compute disjoint tours that
minimize redundant travel, assigning each robot a unique, non-conflicting set
of subareas. Each robot then executes its assigned tour, independently adapting
its coverage strategy within each subarea to minimize path length based on
real-time sensor observations of the subarea. We demonstrate through
simulations and multi-robot hardware experiments that Multi-CAP significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods in key metrics, including coverage time,
total path length, and path overlap ratio. Ablation studies further validate
the critical role of our connectivity-aware graph and the global tour planner
in achieving these performance gains.

Abstract: Semantic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) systems enrich robot
maps with structural and semantic information, enabling robots to operate more
effectively in complex environments. However, these systems struggle in
real-world scenarios with occlusions, incomplete data, or ambiguous geometries,
as they cannot fully leverage the higher-level spatial and semantic knowledge
humans naturally apply. We introduce HICS-SLAM, a Human-in-the-Loop semantic
SLAM framework that uses a shared extended reality environment for real-time
collaboration. The system allows human operators to directly interact with and
visualize the robot's 3D scene graph, and add high-level semantic concepts
(e.g., rooms or structural entities) into the mapping process. We propose a
graph-based semantic fusion methodology that integrates these human
interventions with robot perception, enabling scalable collaboration for
enhanced situational awareness. Experimental evaluations on real-world
construction site datasets demonstrate improvements in room detection accuracy,
map precision, and semantic completeness compared to automated baselines,
demonstrating both the effectiveness of the approach and its potential for
future extensions.

Abstract: We propose a neuromorphic tactile sensing framework for robotic texture
classification that is inspired by human exploratory strategies. Our system
utilizes the NeuroTac sensor to capture neuromorphic tactile data during a
series of exploratory motions. We first tested six distinct motions for texture
classification under fixed environment: sliding, rotating, tapping, as well as
the combined motions: sliding+rotating, tapping+rotating, and tapping+sliding.
We chose sliding and sliding+rotating as the best motions based on final
accuracy and the sample timing length needed to reach converged accuracy. In
the second experiment designed to simulate complex real-world conditions, these
two motions were further evaluated under varying contact depth and speeds.
Under these conditions, our framework attained the highest accuracy of 87.33\%
with sliding+rotating while maintaining an extremely low power consumption of
only 8.04 mW. These results suggest that the sliding+rotating motion is the
optimal exploratory strategy for neuromorphic tactile sensing deployment in
texture classification tasks and holds significant promise for enhancing
robotic environmental interaction.

Abstract: Effective human-robot collaboration in surgery is affected by the inherent
ambiguity of verbal communication. This paper presents a framework for a
robotic surgical assistant that interprets and disambiguates verbal
instructions from a surgeon by grounding them in the visual context of the
operating field. The system employs a two-level affordance-based reasoning
process that first analyzes the surgical scene using a multimodal
vision-language model and then reasons about the instruction using a knowledge
base of tool capabilities. To ensure patient safety, a dual-set conformal
prediction method is used to provide a statistically rigorous confidence
measure for robot decisions, allowing it to identify and flag ambiguous
commands. We evaluated our framework on a curated dataset of ambiguous surgical
requests from cholecystectomy videos, demonstrating a general disambiguation
rate of 60% and presenting a method for safer human-robot interaction in the

Abstract: Quadrotor navigation in unknown environments is critical for practical
missions such as search-and-rescue. Solving it requires addressing three key
challenges: the non-convexity of free space due to obstacles,
quadrotor-specific dynamics and objectives, and the need for exploration of
unknown regions to find a path to the goal. Recently, the Model Predictive Path
Integral (MPPI) method has emerged as a promising solution that solves the
first two challenges. By leveraging sampling-based optimization, it can
effectively handle non-convex free space while directly optimizing over the
full quadrotor dynamics, enabling the inclusion of quadrotor-specific costs
such as energy consumption. However, its performance in unknown environments is
limited, as it lacks the ability to explore unknown regions when blocked by
large obstacles. To solve this issue, we introduce Perception-Aware MPPI
(PA-MPPI). Here, perception-awareness is defined as adapting the trajectory
online based on perception objectives. Specifically, when the goal is occluded,
PA-MPPI's perception cost biases trajectories that can perceive unknown
regions. This expands the mapped traversable space and increases the likelihood
of finding alternative paths to the goal. Through hardware experiments, we
demonstrate that PA-MPPI, running at 50 Hz with our efficient perception and
mapping module, performs up to 100% better than the baseline in our challenging
settings where the state-of-the-art MPPI fails. In addition, we demonstrate
that PA-MPPI can be used as a safe and robust action policy for navigation
foundation models, which often provide goal poses that are not directly
reachable.

Abstract: Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation
in unstructured environments. Details of the demo and supplemental material are
available on our project website https://sites.google.com/view/m4diffuser.

Abstract: In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems,
must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a
wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of
sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for
placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of
the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile
feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand
object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different
parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning
control policies and investigate the relationship between object
characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing
configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of
manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of

Abstract: Scaling up the deployment of autonomous excavators is of great economic and
societal importance. Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems
must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware
configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered,
task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new
scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have
shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as
manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction
machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified
open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining,
and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first
trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then
fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through
both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT
policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy,
successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance
comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation,
we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new
tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while
maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results
highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and
generalizable autonomous excavation.

Abstract: Reliable, drift-free global localization presents significant challenges yet
remains crucial for autonomous navigation in large-scale dynamic environments.
In this paper, we introduce a tightly-coupled Semantic-LiDAR-Inertial-Wheel
Odometry fusion framework, which is specifically designed to provide
high-precision state estimation and robust localization in large-scale dynamic
environments. Our framework leverages an efficient semantic-voxel map
representation and employs an improved scan matching algorithm, which utilizes
global semantic information to significantly reduce long-term trajectory drift.
Furthermore, it seamlessly fuses data from LiDAR, IMU, and wheel odometry using
a tightly-coupled multi-sensor fusion Iterative Error-State Kalman Filter
(iESKF). This ensures reliable localization without experiencing abnormal
drift. Moreover, to tackle the challenges posed by terrain variations and
dynamic movements, we introduce a 3D adaptive scaling strategy that allows for
flexible adjustments to wheel odometry measurement weights, thereby enhancing
localization precision. This study presents extensive real-world experiments
conducted in a one-million-square-meter automated port, encompassing 3,575
hours of operational data from 35 Intelligent Guided Vehicles (IGVs). The
results consistently demonstrate that our system outperforms state-of-the-art
LiDAR-based localization methods in large-scale dynamic environments,
highlighting the framework's reliability and practical value.

Abstract: We propose a new formulation for the multi-robot task allocation problem that
incorporates (a) complex precedence relationships between tasks, (b) efficient
intra-task coordination, and (c) cooperation through the formation of robot
coalitions. A task graph specifies the tasks and their relationships, and a set
of reward functions models the effects of coalition size and preceding task
performance. Maximizing task rewards is NP-hard; hence, we propose network
flow-based algorithms to approximate solutions efficiently. A novel online
algorithm performs iterative re-allocation, providing robustness to task
failures and model inaccuracies to achieve higher performance than offline
approaches. We comprehensively evaluate the algorithms in a testbed with random
missions and reward functions and compare them to a mixed-integer solver and a
greedy heuristic. Additionally, we validate the overall approach in an advanced
simulator, modeling reward functions based on realistic physical phenomena and
executing the tasks with realistic robot dynamics. Results establish efficacy
in modeling complex missions and efficiency in generating high-fidelity task
plans while leveraging task relationships.

Abstract: The ultimate goal of embodied agents is to create collaborators that can
interact with humans, not mere executors that passively follow instructions.
This requires agents to communicate, coordinate, and adapt their actions based
on human feedback. Recently, advances in VLAs have offered a path toward this
goal. However, most current VLA-based embodied agents operate in a one-way
mode: they receive an instruction and execute it without feedback. This
approach fails in real-world scenarios where instructions are often ambiguous.
In this paper, we address this problem with the Ask-to-Clarify framework. Our
framework first resolves ambiguous instructions by asking questions in a
multi-turn dialogue. Then it generates low-level actions end-to-end.
Specifically, the Ask-to-Clarify framework consists of two components, one VLM
for collaboration and one diffusion for action. We also introduce a connection
module that generates conditions for the diffusion based on the output of the
VLM. This module adjusts the observation by instructions to create reliable
conditions. We train our framework with a two-stage knowledge-insulation
strategy. First, we fine-tune the collaboration component using
ambiguity-solving dialogue data to handle ambiguity. Then, we integrate the
action component while freezing the collaboration one. This preserves the
interaction abilities while fine-tuning the diffusion to generate actions. The
training strategy guarantees our framework can first ask questions, then
generate actions. During inference, a signal detector functions as a router
that helps our framework switch between asking questions and taking actions. We
evaluate the Ask-to-Clarify framework in 8 real-world tasks, where it
outperforms existing state-of-the-art VLAs. The results suggest that our
proposed framework, along with the training strategy, provides a path toward
collaborative embodied agents.

Abstract: Future planetary exploration rovers must operate for extended durations on
hybrid power inputs that combine steady radioisotope thermoelectric generator
(RTG) output with variable solar photovoltaic (PV) availability. While
energy-aware planning has been studied for aerial and underwater robots under
battery limits, few works for ground rovers explicitly model power flow or
enforce instantaneous power constraints. Classical terrain-aware planners
emphasize slope or traversability, and trajectory optimization methods
typically focus on geometric smoothness and dynamic feasibility, neglecting
energy feasibility. We present an energy-constrained trajectory planning
framework that explicitly integrates physics-based models of translational,
rotational, and resistive power with baseline subsystem loads, under hybrid
RTG-solar input. By incorporating both cumulative energy budgets and
instantaneous power constraints into SE(2)-based polynomial trajectory
optimization, the method ensures trajectories that are simultaneously smooth,
dynamically feasible, and power-compliant. Simulation results on lunar-like
terrain show that our planner generates trajectories with peak power within
0.55 percent of the prescribed limit, while existing methods exceed limits by
over 17 percent. This demonstrates a principled and practical approach to
energy-aware autonomy for long-duration planetary missions.

Abstract: Multivariate time-series anomaly detection, which is critical for identifying
unexpected events, has been explored in the field of machine learning for
several decades. However, directly applying these methods to data from forceful
tool use tasks is challenging because streaming sensor data in the real world
tends to be inherently noisy, exhibits non-stationary behavior, and varies
across different tasks and tools. To address these challenges, we propose a
method, AnoF-Diff, based on the diffusion model to extract force-torque
features from time-series data and use force-torque features to detect
anomalies. We compare our method with other state-of-the-art methods in terms
of F1-score and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC)
on four forceful tool-use tasks, demonstrating that our method has better
performance and is more robust to a noisy dataset. We also propose the method
of parallel anomaly score evaluation based on one-step diffusion and
demonstrate how our method can be used for online anomaly detection in several
forceful tool use experiments.

Abstract: Soft growing robots, commonly referred to as vine robots, have demonstrated
remarkable ability to interact safely and robustly with unstructured and
dynamic environments. It is therefore natural to exploit contact with the
environment for planning and design optimization tasks. Previous research has
focused on planning under contact for passively deforming robots with
pre-formed bends. However, adding active steering to these soft growing robots
is necessary for successful navigation in more complex environments. To this
end, we develop a unified modeling framework that integrates vine robot growth,
bending, actuation, and obstacle contact. We extend the beam moment model to
include the effects of actuation on kinematics under growth and then use these
models to develop a fast parallel simulation framework. We validate our model
and simulator with real robot experiments. To showcase the capabilities of our
framework, we apply our model in a design optimization task to find designs for
vine robots navigating through cluttered environments, identifying designs that
minimize the number of required actuators by exploiting environmental contacts.
We show the robustness of the designs to environmental and manufacturing
uncertainties. Finally, we fabricate an optimized design and successfully
deploy it in an obstacle-rich environment.
