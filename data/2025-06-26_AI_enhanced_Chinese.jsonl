PSALM-V bootstraps reliable symbolic planning\nwithout expert action definitions, using LLMs to generate heuristic plans and\ncandidate symbolic semantics. Previous work has explored using large language\nmodels to generate action semantics for Planning Domain Definition Language\n(PDDL)-based symbolic planners. However, these approaches have primarily\nfocused on text-based domains or relied on unrealistic assumptions, such as\naccess to a predefined problem file, full observability, or explicit error\nmessages. By contrast, PSALM-V dynamically infers PDDL problem files and domain\naction semantics by analyzing execution outcomes and synthesizing possible\nerror explanations. The system iteratively generates and executes plans while\nmaintaining a tree-structured belief over possible action semantics for each\naction, iteratively refining these beliefs until a goal state is reached.\nSimulated experiments of task completion in ALFRED demonstrate that PSALM-V\nincreases the plan success rate from 37% (Claude-3.7) to 74% in partially\nobserved setups. Results on two 2D game environments, RTFM and Overcooked-AI,\nshow that PSALM-V improves step efficiency and succeeds in domain induction in\nmulti-agent settings.

First, a 2D fusion navigation strategy is\nexplored, initially for mobile robots, enabling safe movement in dynamic\nsettings.

However, new challenges exist when moving\ninto natural, less-structured environments, such as forestry applications. This\npaper presents a prototype system for autonomous, under-canopy forest inventory\nwith legged platforms. Motivated by the robustness and mobility of modern\nlegged robots, we introduce a system architecture which enabled a quadruped\nplatform to autonomously navigate and map forest plots. Our solution involves a\ncomplete navigation stack for state estimation, mission planning, and tree\ndetection and trait estimation. We report the performance of the system from\ntrials executed over one and a half years in forests in three European\ncountries. Our results with the ANYmal robot demonstrate that we can survey\nplots up to 1 ha plot under 30 min, while also identifying trees with typical\nDBH accuracy of 2cm. The findings of this project are presented as five lessons\nand challenges. Particularly, we discuss the maturity of hardware development,\nstate estimation limitations, open problems in forest navigation, future\navenues for robotic forest inventory, and more general challenges to assess\nautonomous systems.

In this work, we introduce a general estimation framework that\nleverages paired data across test platforms, e.g., paired simulation and\nreal-world observations, to achieve better estimates of real-world metrics via\nthe method of control variates. By incorporating cheap and abundant auxiliary\nmeasurements (for example, simulator outputs) as control variates for costly\nreal-world samples, our method provably reduces the variance of Monte Carlo\nestimates and thus requires significantly fewer real-world samples to attain a\nspecified confidence bound on the mean performance. We provide theoretical\nanalysis characterizing the variance and sample-efficiency improvement, and\ndemonstrate empirically in autonomous driving and quadruped robotics settings\nthat our approach achieves high-probability bounds with markedly improved\nsample efficiency. Our technique can lower the real-world testing burden for\nvalidating the performance of the stack, thereby enabling more efficient and\ncost-effective experimental evaluation of robotic systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u5229\u7528\u914d\u5bf9\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u4eff\u771f\u548c\u73b0\u5b9e\u89c2\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6240\u9700\u7684\u73b0\u5b9e\u6837\u672c\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9ad8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u6570\u636e\u4e0d\u8db3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u5229\u7528\u63a7\u5236\u53d8\u91cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5ec9\u4ef7\u8f85\u52a9\u6d4b\u91cf\uff08\u5982\u4eff\u771f\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u4f18\u5316\u8499\u7279\u5361\u7f57\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u73b0\u5b9e\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8d1f\u62c5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5730\u8bc4\u4f30\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Large vision-language models (VLMs) offer promising generalizable\nperceptual capabilities but often suffer from high latency, which negatively\nimpacts user experience and limits VLM applicability in real-world scenarios.\nTo systematically study VLM capabilities in human perception for HRI and\nperformance-latency trade-offs, we introduce HRIBench, a visual\nquestion-answering (VQA) benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs across a diverse\nset of human perceptual tasks critical for HRI. HRIBench covers five key\ndomains: (1) non-verbal cue understanding, (2) verbal instruction\nunderstanding, (3) human-robot object relationship understanding, (4) social\nnavigation, and (5) person identification. To construct HRIBench, we collected\ndata from real-world HRI environments to curate questions for non-verbal cue\nunderstanding, and leveraged publicly available datasets for the remaining four\ndomains. We curated 200 VQA questions for each domain, resulting in a total of\n1000 questions for HRIBench. We then conducted a comprehensive evaluation of\nboth state-of-the-art closed-source and open-source VLMs (N=11) on HRIBench.\nOur results show that, despite their generalizability, current VLMs still\nstruggle with core perceptual capabilities essential for HRI. Moreover, none of\nthe models within our experiments demonstrated a satisfactory\nperformance-latency trade-off suitable for real-time deployment, underscoring\nthe need for future research on developing smaller, low-latency VLMs with\nimproved human perception capabilities.

We introduce a bit-rate\nmetric based on the expected binary codeword length to quantify communication\ncost. Using this metric, we formulate the compression design problem as a\nrate-distortion optimization problem that determines when to communicate, which\nregions of the map should be included in the compressed representation, and at\nwhat resolution (i.e., quantization level) they should be encoded. Our\nformulation allows different map regions to be encoded at varying quantization\nlevels based on their relevance to the Seeker's path-planning task. We\ndemonstrate that the resulting optimization problem is convex, and admits a\nclosed-form solution known in the information theory literature as reverse\nwater-filling, enabling efficient, low-computation, and real-time\nimplementation. Additionally, we show that the Seeker can infer the compression\ndecisions of the Supporter independently, requiring only the encoded map\ncontent and not the encoding policy itself to be transmitted, thereby reducing\ncommunication overhead.

Under Review", "summary": "We propose DemoDiffusion, a simple and scalable method for enabling robots to\nperform manipulation tasks in natural environments by imitating a single human\ndemonstration. Our approach is based on two key insights. First, the hand\nmotion in a human demonstration provides a useful prior for the robot's\nend-effector trajectory, which we can convert into a rough open-loop robot\nmotion trajectory via kinematic retargeting. Second, while this retargeted\nmotion captures the overall structure of the task, it may not align well with\nplausible robot actions in-context. To address this, we leverage a pre-trained\ngeneralist diffusion policy to modify the trajectory, ensuring it both follows\nthe human motion and remains within the distribution of plausible robot\nactions. Our approach avoids the need for online reinforcement learning or\npaired human-robot data, enabling robust adaptation to new tasks and scenes\nwith minimal manual effort. Experiments in both simulation and real-world\nsettings show that DemoDiffusion outperforms both the base policy and the\nretargeted trajectory, enabling the robot to succeed even on tasks where the\npre-trained generalist policy fails entirely.
