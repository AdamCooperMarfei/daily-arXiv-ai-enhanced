### [1] [CAVER: Curious Audiovisual Exploring Robot](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07619)
*Luca Macesanu,Boueny Folefack,Samik Singh,Ruchira Ray,Ben Abbatematteo,Roberto Martín-Martín*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: CAVER是一个新颖的机器人系统，通过主动交互构建多模态视听表征，包含专用末端执行器、视听表征方法和好奇心驱动的探索算法，在材料分类和音频演示模仿方面表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态视听感知可以为机器人操作开辟新途径，从更好的材料分类到仅凭音频信号的演示模仿。但机器人需要学习物体视觉外观与交互产生声音之间的相关性，这需要新的交互能力、表征和探索方法。

Method: 1) 3D打印末端执行器，可激发物体音频响应；2) 结合局部和全局外观信息与声音特征的视听表征；3) 好奇心驱动探索算法，优先与高不确定性物体交互，以较少交互获得良好音频覆盖。

Result: CAVER在不同场景中比多个探索基线更有效地构建丰富表征，学习到的视听表征在材料分类和音频人类演示模仿方面带来显著改进。

Conclusion: CAVER系统通过主动交互成功构建了丰富的视听表征，在多模态机器人感知任务中表现出高效性和有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal audiovisual perception can enable new avenues for robotic manipulation, from better material classification to the imitation of demonstrations for which only audio signals are available (e.g., playing a tune by ear). However, to unlock such multimodal potential, robots need to learn the correlations between an object's visual appearance and the sound it generates when they interact with it. Such an active sensorimotor experience requires new interaction capabilities, representations, and exploration methods to guide the robot in efficiently building increasingly rich audiovisual knowledge. In this work, we present CAVER, a novel robot that builds and utilizes rich audiovisual representations of objects. CAVER includes three novel contributions: 1) a novel 3D printed end-effector, attachable to parallel grippers, that excites objects' audio responses, 2) an audiovisual representation that combines local and global appearance information with sound features, and 3) an exploration algorithm that uses and builds the audiovisual representation in a curiosity-driven manner that prioritizes interacting with high uncertainty objects to obtain good coverage of surprising audio with fewer interactions. We demonstrate that CAVER builds rich representations in different scenarios more efficiently than several exploration baselines, and that the learned audiovisual representation leads to significant improvements in material classification and the imitation of audio-only human demonstrations. https://caver-bot.github.io/

### [2] [Time-Aware Policy Learning for Adaptive and Punctual Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07654)
*Yinsen Jia,Boyuan Chen*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出时间感知策略学习框架，让机器人将时间作为首要变量进行感知和推理，通过剩余时间和时间比率两个时间信号，使单一策略能在快速动态到谨慎精确之间连续调节行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大多数机器人学习算法对时间不敏感，而时间感知是动物和人类智能行为的基础，指导动作的排序、节奏和适应变化的目标与环境。

Method: 在传统强化学习策略基础上增加剩余时间和时间比率两个互补的时间信号，联合优化准时性和稳定性，无需重新训练或奖励调整。

Result: 在多种操作任务中，时间感知策略比标准强化学习基线效率提升48%，模拟到真实迁移鲁棒性提高8倍，声学安静度提升90%，同时保持接近完美的成功率。

Conclusion: 通过将时间视为行为的可控维度而非约束，时间感知策略学习为高效、鲁棒、有弹性和与人类对齐的机器人自主性提供了统一基础。

Abstract: Temporal awareness underlies intelligent behavior in both animals and humans, guiding how actions are sequenced, paced, and adapted to changing goals and environments. Yet most robot learning algorithms remain blind to time. We introduce time-aware policy learning, a reinforcement learning framework that enables robots to explicitly perceive and reason with time as a first-class variable. The framework augments conventional reinforcement policies with two complementary temporal signals, the remaining time and a time ratio, which allow a single policy to modulate its behavior continuously from rapid and dynamic to cautious and precise execution. By jointly optimizing punctuality and stability, the robot learns to balance efficiency, robustness, resiliency, and punctuality without re-training or reward adjustment. Across diverse manipulation domains from long-horizon pick and place, to granular-media pouring, articulated-object handling, and multi-agent object delivery, the time-aware policy produces adaptive behaviors that outperform standard reinforcement learning baselines by up to 48% in efficiency, 8 times more robust in sim-to-real transfer, and 90% in acoustic quietness while maintaining near-perfect success rates. Explicit temporal reasoning further enables real-time human-in-the-loop control and multi-agent coordination, allowing robots to recover from disturbances, re-synchronize after delays, and align motion tempo with human intent. By treating time not as a constraint but as a controllable dimension of behavior, time-aware policy learning provides a unified foundation for efficient, robust, resilient, and human-aligned robot autonomy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在受控环境中测试海洋机器人系统具有挑战性，特别是当声学传感器和控制面仅在水下正常工作时。室内水池测试面临空间限制，难以大规模测试控制、导航和感知算法。

Method: 使用HoloOcean 2.0模拟器，建立硬件在环和软件在环测试设置，通过ROS 2桥接将模拟传感器数据发送给CougUV鱼雷AUV，并将控制命令反馈回模拟器进行动力学和传感器数据计算。

Conclusion: 高保真水下模拟工具如HoloOcean 2.0可以有效解决海洋机器人测试的空间限制问题，为控制、导航和感知算法的大规模测试提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Testing marine robotics systems in controlled environments before field tests is challenging, especially when acoustic-based sensors and control surfaces only function properly underwater. Deploying robots in indoor tanks and pools often faces space constraints that complicate testing of control, navigation, and perception algorithms at scale. Recent developments of high-fidelity underwater simulation tools have the potential to address these problems. We demonstrate the utility of the recently released HoloOcean 2.0 simulator with improved dynamics for torpedo AUV vehicles and a new ROS 2 interface. We have successfully demonstrated a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) and Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) setup for testing and evaluating a CougUV torpedo autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) that was built and developed in our lab. With this HIL and SIL setup, simulations are run in HoloOcean using a ROS 2 bridge such that simulated sensor data is sent to the CougUV (mimicking sensor drivers) and control surface commands are sent back to the simulation, where vehicle dynamics and sensor data are calculated. We compare our simulated results to real-world field trial results.

### [4] [RoboTAG: End-to-end Robot Configuration Estimation via Topological Alignment Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07717)

Main category: cs.RO

Conclusion: RoboTAG通过引入3D先验和跨分支一致性监督，有效减少了标注数据依赖，为机器人姿态估计提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating robot pose from a monocular RGB image is a challenge in robotics and computer vision. Existing methods typically build networks on top of 2D visual backbones and depend heavily on labeled data for training, which is often scarce in real-world scenarios, causing a sim-to-real gap. Moreover, these approaches reduce the 3D-based problem to 2D domain, neglecting the 3D priors. To address these, we propose Robot Topological Alignment Graph (RoboTAG), which incorporates a 3D branch to inject 3D priors while enabling co-evolution of the 2D and 3D representations, alleviating the reliance on labels. Specifically, the RoboTAG consists of a 3D branch and a 2D branch, where nodes represent the states of the camera and robot system, and edges capture the dependencies between these variables or denote alignments between them. Closed loops are then defined in the graph, on which a consistency supervision across branches can be applied. This design allows us to utilize in-the-wild images as training data without annotations. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is effective across robot types, highlighting its potential to alleviate the data bottleneck in robotics.

Abstract: Robot learning empowers the robot system with human brain-like intelligence to autonomously acquire and adapt skills through experience, enhancing flexibility and adaptability in various environments. Aimed at achieving a similar level of capability in large language models (LLMs) for embodied intelligence, data quality plays a crucial role in training a foundational model with diverse robot skills. In this study, we investigate the collection of data for manipulation tasks using teleoperation devices. Different devices yield varying effects when paired with corresponding controller strategies, including position-based inverse kinematics (IK) control, torque-based inverse dynamics (ID) control, and optimization-based compliance control. In this paper, we develop a teleoperation pipeline that is compatible with different teleoperation devices and manipulator controllers. Within the pipeline, we construct the optimal QP formulation with the dynamic nullspace and the impedance tracking as the novel optimal controller to achieve compliant pose tracking and singularity avoidance. Regarding the optimal controller, it adaptively adjusts the weights assignment depending on the robot joint manipulability that reflects the state of joint configuration for the pose tracking in the form of impedance control and singularity avoidance with nullspace tracking. Analysis of quantitative experimental results suggests the quality of the teleoperated trajectory data, including tracking error, occurrence of singularity, and the smoothness of the joints' trajectory, with different combinations of teleoperation interface and the motion controller.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出一个结合任务规划和运动规划的TAMP框架，用于移动机器人多物体操作任务，利用大语言模型的常识知识来指导物体放置策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决移动操作任务中物体放置位置不确定的问题，特别是在目标描述不明确的情况下（如"布置餐桌"），需要结合常识知识来确定物体应该放在哪里以及如何放置。

Method: 结合大语言模型的常识知识进行任务级规划，使用计算机视觉方法选择机器人基座位置，提出一个原则性的TAMP框架来协调导航和操作动作。

Result: 在真实世界和模拟环境中进行定量实验，机器人完成了84.4%的真实世界物体重排任务，但主观人类评估显示其性能仍低于经验丰富的人类服务员。

Conclusion: 该TAMP框架能够有效处理多物体移动操作任务，利用LLM的常识知识适应新情境，但在性能上仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Task planning and motion planning are two of the most important problems in robotics, where task planning methods help robots achieve high-level goals and motion planning methods maintain low-level feasibility. Task and motion planning (TAMP) methods interleave the two processes of task planning and motion planning to ensure goal achievement and motion feasibility. Within the TAMP context, we are concerned with the mobile manipulation (MoMa) of multiple objects, where it is necessary to interleave actions for navigation and manipulation.
  In particular, we aim to compute where and how each object should be placed given underspecified goals, such as ``set up dinner table with a fork, knife and plate.'' We leverage the rich common sense knowledge from large language models (LLMs), e.g., about how tableware is organized, to facilitate both task-level and motion-level planning. In addition, we use computer vision methods to learn a strategy for selecting base positions to facilitate MoMa behaviors, where the base position corresponds to the robot's ``footprint'' and orientation in its operating space. Altogether, this article provides a principled TAMP framework for MoMa tasks that accounts for common sense about object rearrangement and is adaptive to novel situations that include many objects that need to be moved. We performed quantitative experiments in both real-world settings and simulated environments. We evaluated the success rate and efficiency in completing long-horizon object rearrangement tasks. While the robot completed 84.4\% real-world object rearrangement trials, subjective human evaluations indicated that the robot's performance is still lower than experienced human waiters.

### [7] [ViPRA: Video Prediction for Robot Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07732)
*Sandeep Routray,Hengkai Pan,Unnat Jain,Shikhar Bahl,Deepak Pathak*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: ViPRA是一个从无动作标签视频中学习机器人控制的预训练-微调框架，通过预测未来视觉观察和运动中心潜在动作来学习连续控制，仅需少量演示即可实现跨具身智能体的泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数视频（包括人类或遥操作机器人视频）缺乏动作标签，限制了它们在机器人学习中的应用。需要一种方法能够从这些无动作视频中学习机器人控制。

Method: 训练视频语言模型预测未来视觉观察和运动中心潜在动作，使用感知损失和光流一致性确保物理基础行为。下游控制使用分块流匹配解码器将潜在动作映射到机器人特定连续动作序列。

Result: 在SIMPLER基准上提升16%，在真实世界操作任务上提升13%，支持22Hz的高频连续控制，仅需100-200个遥操作演示。

Conclusion: ViPRA能够从无动作视频中有效学习机器人控制，避免昂贵的动作标注，支持跨具身智能体泛化，实现平滑高频控制。

Abstract: Can we turn a video prediction model into a robot policy? Videos, including those of humans or teleoperated robots, capture rich physical interactions. However, most of them lack labeled actions, which limits their use in robot learning. We present Video Prediction for Robot Actions (ViPRA), a simple pretraining-finetuning framework that learns continuous robot control from these actionless videos. Instead of directly predicting actions, we train a video-language model to predict both future visual observations and motion-centric latent actions, which serve as intermediate representations of scene dynamics. We train these latent actions using perceptual losses and optical flow consistency to ensure they reflect physically grounded behavior. For downstream control, we introduce a chunked flow matching decoder that maps latent actions to robot-specific continuous action sequences, using only 100 to 200 teleoperated demonstrations. This approach avoids expensive action annotation, supports generalization across embodiments, and enables smooth, high-frequency continuous control upto 22 Hz via chunked action decoding. Unlike prior latent action works that treat pretraining as autoregressive policy learning, explicitly models both what changes and how. Our method outperforms strong baselines, with a 16% gain on the SIMPLER benchmark and a 13% improvement across real world manipulation tasks. We will release models and code at https://vipra-project.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 在JAX中实现风和气球动力学作为可微分函数，使用基于梯度的轨迹优化进行在线规划，开发一阶模型预测控制(FOMPC)方法。

Result: FOMPC优于最先进的强化学习策略，在保持半径内时间(TWR)指标上实现24%的改进，无需离线训练，但每个控制步骤需要更多在线计算。

Conclusion: 在线规划在多种配置下都有效，包括简化的风和动力学模型，证明模型控制在高空气球站控中的实用性。

Abstract: High-altitude balloons (HABs) are common in scientific research due to their wide range of applications and low cost. Because of their nonlinear, underactuated dynamics and the partial observability of wind fields, prior work has largely relied on model-free reinforcement learning (RL) methods to design near-optimal control schemes for station-keeping. These methods often compare only against hand-crafted heuristics, dismissing model-based approaches as impractical given the system complexity and uncertain wind forecasts. We revisit this assumption about the efficacy of model-based control for station-keeping by developing First-Order Model Predictive Control (FOMPC). By implementing the wind and balloon dynamics as differentiable functions in JAX, we enable gradient-based trajectory optimization for online planning. FOMPC outperforms a state-of-the-art RL policy, achieving a 24% improvement in time-within-radius (TWR) without requiring offline training, though at the cost of greater online computation per control step. Through systematic ablations of modeling assumptions and control factors, we show that online planning is effective across many configurations, including under simplified wind and dynamics models.

Motivation: 现有的视觉触觉传感器使用硅胶凝胶，虽然灵敏度高但容易因负载和表面磨损而劣化。聚氨酯橡胶在高负载应用中表现出更好的物理弹性，可能提供改进的传感器耐用性。

Method: 提出了标准评估基准协议，包括弹性测试（正常负载、剪切负载、磨损测试）和灵敏度测试（无模型评估力和空间灵敏度）。通过瓶盖拧紧演示比较两种材料的性能。

Result: 聚氨酯橡胶在物理弹性方面优于硅胶，可能在灵敏度方面有所牺牲。在瓶盖拧紧任务中，聚氨酯凝胶显示出比硅胶更好的性能。

Conclusion: 聚氨酯橡胶可以作为视觉触觉传感器的可行替代材料，提供更好的耐用性，特别适合高负载应用场景，尽管可能需要在灵敏度方面做出一些权衡。

Abstract: Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTSs) are a promising technology for robots, providing them with dense signals that can be translated into an understanding of normal and shear load, contact region, texture classification, and more. However, existing VBTS tactile surfaces make use of silicone gels, which provide high sensitivity but easily deteriorate from loading and surface wear. We propose that polyurethane rubber, used for high-load applications like shoe soles, rubber wheels, and industrial gaskets, may provide improved physical gel resilience, potentially at the cost of sensitivity. To compare the resilience and sensitivity of silicone and polyurethane VBTS gels, we propose a series of standard evaluation benchmarking protocols. Our resilience tests assess sensor durability across normal loading, shear loading, and abrasion. For sensitivity, we introduce model-free assessments of force and spatial sensitivity to directly measure the physical capabilities of each gel without effects introduced from data and model quality. Finally, we include a bottle cap loosening and tightening demonstration as an example where polyurethane gels provide an advantage over their silicone counterparts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统集中式规划方法会完全控制机器人路径，而分散式方法容易产生冲突和死锁，需要一种既能保持机器人自主性又能有效解决冲突的协调方法

Method: 每个机器人自主规划路径并共享给集中节点，集中系统检测潜在冲突，只允许一个冲突机器人通过，其他机器人在冲突区域外停止，类似虚拟交通灯

Result: 在多个机器人的仿真实验中，该方法提高了机器人到达目标的成功率并减少了死锁；在真实实验中，分别在四足机器人和轮式Duckiebots上成功验证

Conclusion: 该混合协调框架有效结合了分散式规划的自主性和集中式冲突解决的优势，能够提高多机器人系统的效率和可靠性

Abstract: We present a hybrid multi-robot coordination framework that combines decentralized path planning with centralized conflict resolution. In our approach, each robot autonomously plans its path and shares this information with a centralized node. The centralized system detects potential conflicts and allows only one of the conflicting robots to proceed at a time, instructing others to stop outside the conflicting area to avoid deadlocks. Unlike traditional centralized planning methods, our system does not dictate robot paths but instead provides stop commands, functioning as a virtual traffic light. In simulation experiments with multiple robots, our approach increased the success rate of robots reaching their goals while reducing deadlocks. Furthermore, we successfully validated the system in real-world experiments with two quadruped robots and separately with wheeled Duckiebots.

Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.

Abstract: This paper considers the problem of searching for a point of interest (POI) moving along an urban road network with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability.

Abstract: Organisms in nature, such as Cephalopods and Pachyderms, exploit stiffness modulation to achieve amazing dexterity in the control of their appendages. In this paper, we explore the phenomenon of layer jamming, which is a popular stiffness modulation mechanism that provides an equivalent capability for soft robots. More specifically, we focus on mechanical layer jamming, which we realise through two-layer multi material structure with tooth-like protrusions. We identify key design parameters for mechanical layer jamming systems, including the ability to modulate stiffness, and perform a variety of comprehensive tests placing the specimens under bending and torsional loads to understand the influence of our selected design parameters (mainly tooth geometry) on the performance of the jammed structures. We note the ability of these structures to produce a peak change in stiffness of 5 times in bending and 3.2 times in torsion. We also measure the force required to separate the two jammed layers, an often ignored parameter in the study of jamming-induced stiffness change.

Abstract: Dynamic modeling and control are critical for unleashing soft robots' potential, yet remain challenging due to their complex constitutive behaviors and real-world operating conditions. Bio-inspired musculoskeletal robots, which integrate rigid skeletons with soft actuators, combine high load-bearing capacity with inherent flexibility. Although actuation dynamics have been studied through experimental methods and surrogate models, accurate and effective modeling and simulation remain a significant challenge, especially for large-scale hybrid rigid--soft robots with continuously distributed mass, kinematic loops, and diverse motion modes. To address these challenges, we propose EquiMus, an energy-equivalent dynamic modeling framework and MuJoCo-based simulation for musculoskeletal rigid--soft hybrid robots with linear elastic actuators. The equivalence and effectiveness of the proposed approach are validated and examined through both simulations and real-world experiments on a bionic robotic leg. EquiMus further demonstrates its utility for downstream tasks, including controller design and learning-based control strategies.

TL;DR: 提出基于模型预测控制的步态规划策略，通过优化脚步位置来抑制不期望的身体旋转，实现更稳健的腿部机器人运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于模型的运动控制方法通常采用启发式方法或线性倒立摆模型规划，这些方法在步态规划中只考虑线速度而忽略角速度，导致角动量控制仅通过地面反作用力处理，限制了控制性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a footstep planning strategy based on model predictive control (MPC) that enables robust regulation of body orientation against undesired body rotations by optimizing footstep placement. Model-based locomotion approaches typically adopt heuristic methods or planning based on the linear inverted pendulum model. These methods account for linear velocity in footstep planning, while excluding angular velocity, which leads to angular momentum being handled exclusively via ground reaction force (GRF). Footstep planning based on MPC that takes angular velocity into account recasts the angular momentum control problem as a dual-input approach that coordinates GRFs and footstep placement, instead of optimizing GRFs alone, thereby improving tracking performance. A mutual-feedback loop couples the footstep planner and the GRF MPC, with each using the other's solution to iteratively update footsteps and GRFs. The use of optimal solutions reduces body oscillation and enables extended stance and swing phases. The method is validated on a quadruped robot, demonstrating robust locomotion with reduced oscillations, longer stance and swing phases across various terrains.

Abstract: Obstacle avoidance and path planning are essential for guiding unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) through environments that are densely populated with dynamic obstacles. This paper develops a novel approach that combines tangentbased path planning and extrapolation methods to create a new decision-making algorithm for local path planning. In the assumed scenario, a UGV has a prior knowledge of its initial and target points within the dynamic environment. A global path has already been computed, and the robot is provided with waypoints along this path. As the UGV travels between these waypoints, the algorithm aims to avoid collisions with dynamic obstacles. These obstacles follow polynomial trajectories, with their initial positions randomized in the local map and velocities randomized between O and the allowable physical velocity limit of the robot, along with some random accelerations. The developed algorithm is tested in several scenarios where many dynamic obstacles move randomly in the environment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed local path planning strategy by gradually generating a collision free path which allows the robot to navigate safely between initial and the target locations.

Abstract: Developing a robust and effective obstacle detection and tracking system for Unmanned Surface Vehicle (USV) at marine environments is a challenging task. Research efforts have been made in this area during the past years by GRAAL lab at the university of Genova that resulted in a methodology for detecting and tracking obstacles on the image plane and, then, locating them in the 3D LiDAR point cloud. In this work, we continue on the developed system by, firstly, evaluating its performance on recently published marine datasets. Then, we integrate the different blocks of the system on ROS platform where we could test it in real-time on synchronized LiDAR and camera data collected in various marine conditions available in the MIT marine datasets. We present a thorough experimental analysis of the results obtained using two approaches; one that uses sensor fusion between the camera and LiDAR to detect and track the obstacles and the other uses only the LiDAR point cloud for the detection and tracking. In the end, we propose a hybrid approach that merges the advantages of both approaches to build an informative obstacles map of the surrounding environment to the USV.

Conclusion: GTNS是一种新颖、可扩展且可证明正确的方法，能够捕捉丰富的现实交互场景，为机器人安全部署提供有效的博弈论推理能力

Abstract: To facilitate effective, safe deployment in the real world, individual robots must reason about interactions with other agents, which often occur without explicit communication. Recent work has identified game theory, particularly the concept of Nash Equilibrium (NE), as a key enabler for behavior-aware decision-making. Yet, existing work falls short of fully unleashing the power of game-theoretic reasoning. Specifically, popular optimization-based methods require simplified robot dynamics and tend to get trapped in local minima due to convexification. Other works that rely on payoff matrices suffer from poor scalability due to the explicit enumeration of all possible trajectories. To bridge this gap, we introduce Game-Theoretic Nested Search (GTNS), a novel, scalable, and provably correct approach for computing NEs in general dynamical systems. GTNS efficiently searches the action space of all agents involved, while discarding trajectories that violate the NE constraint (no unilateral deviation) through an inner search over a lower-dimensional space. Our algorithm enables explicit selection among equilibria by utilizing a user-specified global objective, thereby capturing a rich set of realistic interactions. We demonstrate the approach on a variety of autonomous driving and racing scenarios where we achieve solutions in mere seconds on commodity hardware.

Abstract: Robotic systems driven by conventional motors often suffer from challenges such as large mass, complex control algorithms, and the need for additional braking mechanisms, which limit their applications in lightweight and compact robotic platforms. Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to avoiding jackknifing and mutual collisions in Heavy Articulated Vehicles (HAVs) by leveraging decentralized swarm intelligence. In contrast to typical swarm robotics research, our robots are elongated and exhibit complex kinematics, introducing unique challenges. Despite its relevance to real-world applications such as logistics automation, remote mining, airport baggage transport, and agricultural operations, this problem has not been addressed in the existing literature.
  To tackle this new class of swarm robotics problems, we propose a purely reaction-based, decentralized swarm intelligence strategy tailored to automate elongated, articulated vehicles. The method presented in this paper prioritizes jackknifing avoidance and establishes a foundation for mutual collision avoidance. We validate our approach through extensive simulation experiments and provide a comprehensive analysis of its performance. For the experiments with a single HAV, we observe that for 99.8% jackknifing was successfully avoided and that 86.7% and 83.4% reach their first and second goals, respectively. With two HAVs interacting, we observe 98.9%, 79.4%, and 65.1%, respectively, while 99.7% of the HAVs do not experience mutual collisions.

Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a fundamental framework for optimizing robot behavior over a finite future horizon. While conventional numerical optimization methods can efficiently handle simple dynamics and cost structures, they often become intractable for the nonlinear or non-differentiable systems commonly encountered in robotics. This article provides a tutorial on probabilistic inference-based MPC, presenting a unified theoretical foundation and a comprehensive overview of representative methods. Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics. We first derive the optimal control distribution from the standard optimal control problem, elucidating its probabilistic interpretation and key characteristics. The widely used MPPI algorithm is then derived as a practical example, followed by discussions on prior and variational distribution design, tuning principles, and theoretical aspects. This article aims to serve as a systematic guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, implement, and extend these methods in robotics and beyond.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and multimodal foundation models have significantly broadened their application in robotics and collaborative systems. However, effective multi-agent interaction necessitates robust perspective-taking capabilities, enabling models to interpret both physical and epistemic viewpoints. Current training paradigms often neglect these interactive contexts, resulting in challenges when models must reason about the subjectivity of individual perspectives or navigate environments with multiple observers. This study evaluates whether explicitly incorporating diverse points of view using the ReAct framework, an approach that integrates reasoning and acting, can enhance an LLM's ability to understand and ground the demands of other agents. We extend the classic Director task by introducing active visual exploration across a suite of seven scenarios of increasing perspective-taking complexity. These scenarios are designed to challenge the agent's capacity to resolve referential ambiguity based on visual access and interaction, under varying state representations and prompting strategies, including ReAct-style reasoning. Our results demonstrate that explicit perspective cues, combined with active exploration strategies, significantly improve the model's interpretative accuracy and collaborative effectiveness. These findings highlight the potential of integrating active perception with perspective-taking mechanisms in advancing LLMs' application in robotics and multi-agent systems, setting a foundation for future research into adaptive and context-aware AI systems.

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems, predominantly trained through imitation learning, have demonstrated considerable effectiveness in leveraging large-scale expert driving data. Despite their success in open-loop evaluations, these systems often exhibit significant performance degradation in closed-loop scenarios due to causal confusion. This confusion is fundamentally exacerbated by the overreliance of the imitation learning paradigm on expert trajectories, which often contain unattributable noise and interfere with the modeling of causal relationships between environmental contexts and appropriate driving actions.
  To address this fundamental limitation, we propose Perception-Guided Self-Supervision (PGS) - a simple yet effective training paradigm that leverages perception outputs as the primary supervisory signals, explicitly modeling causal relationships in decision-making. The proposed framework aligns both the inputs and outputs of the decision-making module with perception results, such as lane centerlines and the predicted motions of surrounding agents, by introducing positive and negative self-supervision for the ego trajectory. This alignment is specifically designed to mitigate causal confusion arising from the inherent noise in expert trajectories.
  Equipped with perception-driven supervision, our method, built on a standard end-to-end architecture, achieves a Driving Score of 78.08 and a mean success rate of 48.64% on the challenging closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark, significantly outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods, including those employing more complex network architectures and inference pipelines. These results underscore the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed PGS framework and point to a promising direction for addressing causal confusion and enhancing real-world generalization in autonomous driving.

Abstract: Various neural network architectures are used in many of the state-of-the-art approaches for real-time nonlinear state estimation. With the ever-increasing incorporation of these data-driven models into the estimation domain, model predictions with reliable margins of error are a requirement -- especially for safety-critical applications. This paper discusses the application of a novel real-time, data-driven estimation approach based on the multi-fidelity residual physics-informed neural process (MFR-PINP) toward the real-time state estimation of a robotic system. Specifically, we address the model-mismatch issue of selecting an accurate kinematic model by tasking the MFR-PINP to also learn the residuals between simple, low-fidelity predictions and complex, high-fidelity ground-truth dynamics. To account for model uncertainty present in a physical implementation, robust uncertainty guarantees from the split conformal (SC) prediction framework are modeled in the training and inference paradigms. We provide implementation details of our MFR-PINP-based estimator for a hybrid online learning setting to validate our model's usage in real-time applications. Experimental results of our approach's performance in comparison to the state-of-the-art variants of the Kalman filter (i.e. unscented Kalman filter and deep Kalman filter) in estimation scenarios showed promising results for the MFR-PINP model as a viable option in real-time estimation tasks.

Abstract: Learning-based inertial odometry has achieved remarkable progress in pedestrian navigation. However, extending these methods to quadruped robots remains challenging due to their distinct and highly dynamic motion patterns. Models that perform well on pedestrian data often experience severe degradation when deployed on legged platforms. To tackle this challenge, we introduce X-IONet, a cross-platform inertial odometry framework that operates solely using a single Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). X-IONet incorporates a rule-based expert selection module to classify motion platforms and route IMU sequences to platform-specific expert networks. The displacement prediction network features a dual-stage attention architecture that jointly models long-range temporal dependencies and inter-axis correlations, enabling accurate motion representation. It outputs both displacement and associated uncertainty, which are further fused through an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for robust state estimation. Extensive experiments on public pedestrian datasets and a self-collected quadruped robot dataset demonstrate that X-IONet achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing Absolute Trajectory Error (ATE) by 14.3% and Relative Trajectory Error (RTE) by 11.4% on pedestrian data, and by 52.8% and 41.3% on quadruped robot data. These results highlight the effectiveness of X-IONet in advancing accurate and robust inertial navigation across both human and legged robot platforms.

Abstract: Salamander-like quadruped robots are designed inspired by the skeletal structure of their biological counterparts. However, existing controllers cannot fully exploit these morphological features and largely rely on predefined gait patterns or joint trajectories, which prevents the generation of diverse and flexible locomotion and limits their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a learning framework that enables the robot to acquire a diverse repertoire of omnidirectional gaits without reference motions. Each body part is controlled by a phase variable capable of forward and backward evolution, with a phase coverage reward to promote the exploration of the leg phase space. Additionally, morphological symmetry of the robot is incorporated via data augmentation, improving sample efficiency and enforcing both motion-level and task-level symmetry in learned behaviors. Extensive experiments show that the robot successfully acquires 22 omnidirectional gaits exhibiting both dynamic and symmetric movements, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework.

Abstract: Autonomous Mobile Robots (AMRs) increasingly adopt containerized micro-services across the Edge-Cloud continuum. While Kubernetes is the de-facto orchestrator for such systems, its assumptions of stable networks, homogeneous resources, and ample compute capacity do not fully hold in mobile, resource-constrained robotic environments.
  This paper describes a case study on smart-manufacturing AMRs and performs an initial comparison between CODECO orchestration and standard Kubernetes using a controlled KinD environment. Metrics include pod deployment and deletion times, CPU and memory usage, and inter-pod data rates. The observed results indicate that CODECO offers reduced CPU consumption and more stable communication patterns, at the cost of modest memory overhead (10-15%) and slightly increased pod lifecycle latency due to secure overlay initialization.

Result: 在600个操作者轨迹的回顾性研究中评估了Psychic框架，证明其能够生成概率可达集，并在离线学习和在线学习中有效工作。

Conclusion: Psychic框架能够有效检测操作者意图的突然变化，在非结构化场景中实现早期目标检测和未定义目标发现，为遥操作中的意图推断提供了新方法。

Abstract: Intent inferencing in teleoperation has been instrumental in aligning operator goals and coordinating actions with robotic partners. However, current intent inference methods often ignore subtle motion that can be strong indicators for a sudden change in intent. Specifically, we aim to tackle 1) if we can detect sudden jumps in operator trajectories, 2) how we appropriately use these sudden jump motions to infer an operator's goal state, and 3) how to incorporate these discontinuous and continuous dynamics to infer operator motion. Our framework, called Psychic, models these small indicative motions through a jump-drift-diffusion stochastic differential equation to cover discontinuous and continuous dynamics. Kramers-Moyal (KM) coefficients allow us to detect jumps with a trajectory which we pair with a statistical outlier detection algorithm to nominate goal transitions. Through identifying jumps, we can perform early detection of existing goals and discover undefined goals in unstructured scenarios. Our framework then applies a Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) model using KM coefficients with the goal transitions as a control input to infer an operator's motion behavior in unstructured scenarios. We demonstrate Psychic can produce probabilistic reachability sets and compare our strategy to a negative log-likelihood model fit. We perform a retrospective study on 600 operator trajectories in a hands-free teleoperation task to evaluate the efficacy of our opensource package, Psychic, in both offline and online learning.

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to extend human movement capabilities by enabling direct neural control of supernumerary effectors, yet integrating augmented commands with multiple degrees of freedom without disrupting natural movement remains a key challenge. Here, we propose a tactile-encoded BCI that leverages sensory afferents through a novel tactile-evoked P300 paradigm, allowing intuitive and reliable decoding of supernumerary motor intentions even when superimposed with voluntary actions. The interface was evaluated in a multi-day experiment comprising of a single motor recognition task to validate baseline BCI performance and a dual task paradigm to assess the potential influence between the BCI and natural human movement. The brain interface achieved real-time and reliable decoding of four supernumerary degrees of freedom, with significant performance improvements after only three days of training. Importantly, after training, performance did not differ significantly between the single- and dual-BCI task conditions, and natural movement remained unimpaired during concurrent supernumerary control. Lastly, the interface was deployed in a movement augmentation task, demonstrating its ability to command two supernumerary robotic arms for functional assistance during bimanual tasks. These results establish a new neural interface paradigm for movement augmentation through stimulation of sensory afferents, expanding motor degrees of freedom without impairing natural movement.

Abstract: Concentric tube robots (CTRs) offer dexterous motion at millimeter scales, enabling minimally invasive procedures through natural orifices. This work presents a coordinated model-based resection planner and learning-based retraction network that work together to enable semi-autonomous tissue resection using a dual-arm transurethral concentric tube robot (the Virtuoso). The resection planner operates directly on segmented CT volumes of prostate phantoms, automatically generating tool trajectories for a three-phase median lobe resection workflow: left/median trough resection, right/median trough resection, and median blunt dissection. The retraction network, PushCVAE, trained on surgeon demonstrations, generates retractions according to the procedural phase. The procedure is executed under Level-3 (supervised) autonomy on a prostate phantom composed of hydrogel materials that replicate the mechanical and cutting properties of tissue. As a feasibility study, we demonstrate that our combined autonomous system achieves a 97.1% resection of the targeted volume of the median lobe. Our study establishes a foundation for image-guided autonomy in transurethral robotic surgery and represents a first step toward fully automated minimally-invasive prostate enucleation.

Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly rely on human feedback to align their behavior, expressed as pairwise comparisons, rankings, or demonstrations. While existing methods can adapt behaviors, they often fail to guarantee safety in safety-critical domains. We propose a safety-guaranteed, optimal, and efficient approach to solve the learning problem from preferences, rankings, or demonstrations using Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (WSTL). WSTL learning problems, when implemented naively, lead to multi-linear constraints in the weights to be learned. By introducing structural pruning and log-transform procedures, we reduce the problem size and recast the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program while preserving safety guarantees. Experiments on robotic navigation and real-world Formula 1 data demonstrate that the method effectively captures nuanced preferences and models complex task objectives.

Abstract: Developing efficient and accurate visuomotor policies poses a central challenge in robotic imitation learning. While recent rectified flow approaches have advanced visuomotor policy learning, they suffer from a key limitation: After iterative distillation, generated actions may deviate from the ground-truth actions corresponding to the current visual observation, leading to accumulated error as the reflow process repeats and unstable task execution. We present Selective Flow Alignment (SeFA), an efficient and accurate visuomotor policy learning framework. SeFA resolves this challenge by a selective flow alignment strategy, which leverages expert demonstrations to selectively correct generated actions and restore consistency with observations, while preserving multimodality. This design introduces a consistency correction mechanism that ensures generated actions remain observation-aligned without sacrificing the efficiency of one-step flow inference. Extensive experiments across both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks show that SeFA Policy surpasses state-of-the-art diffusion-based and flow-based policies, achieving superior accuracy and robustness while reducing inference latency by over 98%. By unifying rectified flow efficiency with observation-consistent action generation, SeFA provides a scalable and dependable solution for real-time visuomotor policy learning.
