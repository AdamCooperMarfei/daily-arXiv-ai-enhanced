TL;DR: EO-Robotics是一个统一的具身基础模型，通过交错视觉-文本-动作预训练在机器人控制和多模态推理方面取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型在交错推理和交互方面仍无法达到人类水平的灵活性，需要开发更先进的具身智能系统

Method: 采用统一架构处理多模态输入，构建150万样本的EO-Data1.5M数据集，通过自回归解码和流匹配去噪进行协同训练

Result: 在多个具身上的长时程灵巧操作任务中验证了开放世界理解和泛化能力

Conclusion: 交错视觉-文本-动作学习对开发先进具身基础模型具有重要价值

Abstract: The human ability to seamlessly perform multimodal reasoning and physical
interaction in the open world is a core goal for general-purpose embodied
intelligent systems. Recent vision-language-action (VLA) models, which are
co-trained on large-scale robot and visual-text data, have demonstrated notable
progress in general robot control. However, they still fail to achieve
human-level flexibility in interleaved reasoning and interaction. In this work,
introduce EO-Robotics, consists of EO-1 model and EO-Data1.5M dataset. EO-1 is
a unified embodied foundation model that achieves superior performance in
multimodal embodied reasoning and robot control through interleaved
vision-text-action pre-training. The development of EO-1 is based on two key
pillars: (i) a unified architecture that processes multimodal inputs
indiscriminately (image, text, video, and action), and (ii) a massive,
high-quality multimodal embodied reasoning dataset, EO-Data1.5M, which contains
over 1.5 million samples with emphasis on interleaved vision-text-action
comprehension. EO-1 is trained through synergies between auto-regressive
decoding and flow matching denoising on EO-Data1.5M, enabling seamless robot
action generation and multimodal embodied reasoning. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of interleaved vision-text-action learning for
open-world understanding and generalization, validated through a variety of
long-horizon, dexterous manipulation tasks across multiple embodiments. This
paper details the architecture of EO-1, the data construction strategy of
EO-Data1.5M, and the training methodology, offering valuable insights for
developing advanced embodied foundation models.

### [2] [Observer Design for Optical Flow-Based Visual-Inertial Odometry with Almost-Global Convergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21163)
*Tarek Bouazza,Soulaimane Berkane,Minh-Duc Hua,Tarek Hamel*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合光流和IMU测量的级联观测器架构，用于连续单目视觉惯性里程计(VIO)，通过融合光流速度方向信息和惯性数据来同时估计机体速度与重力方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决单目VIO中连续姿态和速度估计的问题，需要融合视觉和惯性传感器数据，特别是在缺乏深度信息的情况下实现稳定的状态估计。

Method: 使用全局指数稳定的Riccati观测器融合光流速度方向与陀螺仪、加速度计数据，估计机体速度与重力方向；然后在SO(3)上设计互补观测器进行姿态估计；开发梯度下降算法从稀疏光流数据中提取速度方向。

Result: 提出的级联观测器架构被证明具有几乎全局渐近稳定性，仿真结果验证了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了连续单目VIO，通过创新的观测器架构和算法设计，在缺乏深度信息的情况下实现了稳定的状态估计。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel cascaded observer architecture that combines
optical flow and IMU measurements to perform continuous monocular
visual-inertial odometry (VIO). The proposed solution estimates body-frame
velocity and gravity direction simultaneously by fusing velocity direction
information from optical flow measurements with gyro and accelerometer data.
This fusion is achieved using a globally exponentially stable Riccati observer,
which operates under persistently exciting translational motion conditions. The
estimated gravity direction in the body frame is then employed, along with an
optional magnetometer measurement, to design a complementary observer on
$\mathbf{SO}(3)$ for attitude estimation. The resulting interconnected observer
architecture is shown to be almost globally asymptotically stable. To extract
the velocity direction from sparse optical flow data, a gradient descent
algorithm is developed to solve a constrained minimization problem on the unit
sphere. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated through
simulation results.

*Usman A. Khan,Mouhacine Benosman,Wenliang Liu,Federico Pecora,Joseph W. Durham*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 基于最优传输理论和模型预测控制的多机器人路径规划与调度新方法，通过空间离散化和成本结构设计，实现最优且无重叠的轨迹规划


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多机器人在共享空间中导航到多个目标时，先分配目标再规划路径会导致路径重叠和死锁问题，需要一种能同时保证最优性和无冲突的规划方法

Method: 将空间离散化为K个单元格，构建K×K的转移成本矩阵，利用最优传输理论计算最优且无重叠的单元格转移路径，并结合模型预测控制处理动态约束和不可避免的重叠情况

Result: 该方法在最坏情况下需要O(K³logK)计算量，在良好条件下仅需O(K²logK)，能够提供可直接部署的无冲突轨迹规划方案

Conclusion: 最优传输理论为多机器人导航提供了一种有效的路径规划框架，结合模型预测控制可以处理动态约束，实现高效且无冲突的多机器人协同导航

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for path planning and
scheduling for multi-robot navigation that is based on optimal transport theory
and model predictive control. We consider a setup where $N$ robots are tasked
to navigate to $M$ targets in a common space with obstacles. Mapping robots to
targets first and then planning paths can result in overlapping paths that lead
to deadlocks. We derive a strategy based on optimal transport that not only
provides minimum cost paths from robots to targets but also guarantees
non-overlapping trajectories. We achieve this by discretizing the space of
interest into $K$ cells and by imposing a ${K\times K}$ cost structure that
describes the cost of transitioning from one cell to another. Optimal transport
then provides \textit{optimal and non-overlapping} cell transitions for the
robots to reach the targets that can be readily deployed without any scheduling
considerations. The proposed solution requires $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^3\log K)$
computations in the worst-case and $\unicode{x1D4AA}(K^2\log K)$ for
well-behaved problems. To further accommodate potentially overlapping
trajectories (unavoidable in certain situations) as well as robot dynamics, we
show that a temporal structure can be integrated into optimal transport with
the help of \textit{replans} and \textit{model predictive control}.

### [4] [Uncertainty-Aware Ankle Exoskeleton Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21221)
*Fatima Mumtaza Tourk,Bishoy Galoaa,Sanat Shajan,Aaron J. Young,Michael Everett,Max K. Shepherd*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种不确定性感知控制框架，使踝关节外骨骼能够在遇到不熟悉动作时自动断开，从而安全地在多样化场景中操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统下肢外骨骼控制器仅针对离散、预定义动作设计，限制了其在真实世界环境中的实用性。

Method: 使用不确定性估计器将动作分类为与训练集相似（分布内）或不同（分布外），评估了三种架构（模型集成、自编码器和生成对抗网络），并在在线测试中验证了最佳性能架构（步态相位估计器集成）。

Result: 在线测试显示不确定性估计器能够在用户从分布内任务转换到分布外任务时开关辅助功能（F1分数：89.2）。

Conclusion: 该框架为外骨骼在非结构化日常环境中安全自主地支持人体运动提供了途径。

Abstract: Lower limb exoskeletons show promise to assist human movement, but their
utility is limited by controllers designed for discrete, predefined actions in
controlled environments, restricting their real-world applicability. We present
an uncertainty-aware control framework that enables ankle exoskeletons to
operate safely across diverse scenarios by automatically disengaging when
encountering unfamiliar movements. Our approach uses an uncertainty estimator
to classify movements as similar (in-distribution) or different
(out-of-distribution) relative to actions in the training set. We evaluated
three architectures (model ensembles, autoencoders, and generative adversarial
networks) on an offline dataset and tested the strongest performing
architecture (ensemble of gait phase estimators) online. The online test
demonstrated the ability of our uncertainty estimator to turn assistance on and
off as the user transitioned between in-distribution and out-of-distribution
tasks (F1: 89.2). This new framework provides a path for exoskeletons to safely
and autonomously support human movement in unstructured, everyday environments.

### [5] [Remarks on stochastic cloning and delayed-state filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21260)
*Tara Mina,Lindsey Marinello,John Christian*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器，证明其与随机克隆方法在处理延迟状态测量时具有相同的状态和协方差更新效果，但计算效率更高且内存需求更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器人学和导航中的许多估计问题涉及依赖于先前状态的测量（如里程计），传统方法使用随机克隆来处理这些延迟状态测量的相关性，但该方法需要状态向量增广，计算和内存成本较高。

Method: 采用广义卡尔曼滤波器公式，推导出延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器，无需状态增广即可处理相关延迟状态测量，保持与随机克隆相同的数学等价性。

Result: 证明延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器与随机克隆方法产生完全相同的状态和协方差更新，同时在计算效率上有优势，对高维状态的内存需求更低。

Conclusion: 卡尔曼滤波器变体本质上能够处理相关延迟状态测量，延迟状态卡尔曼滤波器提供了一种更高效的替代方案，澄清了该领域的常见误解。

Abstract: Many estimation problems in robotics and navigation involve measurements that
depend on prior states. A prominent example is odometry, which measures the
relative change between states over time. Accurately handling these
delayed-state measurements requires capturing their correlations with prior
state estimates, and a widely used approach is stochastic cloning (SC), which
augments the state vector to account for these correlations.
  This work revisits a long-established but often overlooked alternative--the
delayed-state Kalman filter--and demonstrates that a properly derived filter
yields exactly the same state and covariance update as SC, without requiring
state augmentation. Moreover, the generalized Kalman filter formulation
provides computational advantages, while also reducing memory requirements for
higher-dimensional states.
  Our findings clarify a common misconception that Kalman filter variants are
inherently unable to handle correlated delayed-state measurements,
demonstrating that an alternative formulation achieves the same results more
efficiently.

Conclusion: 提出的3D CNN方法在模拟环境中显示出良好的自动驾驶控制性能，为自动驾驶算法的快速评估提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Autonomous driving applications have become increasingly relevant in the
automotive industry due to their potential to enhance vehicle safety,
efficiency, and user experience, thereby meeting the growing demand for
sophisticated driving assistance features. However, the development of reliable
and trustworthy autonomous systems poses challenges such as high complexity,
prolonged training periods, and intrinsic levels of uncertainty. Mini
Autonomous Cars (MACs) are used as a practical testbed, enabling validation of
autonomous control methodologies on small-scale setups. This simplified and
cost-effective environment facilitates rapid evaluation and comparison of
machine learning models, which is particularly useful for algorithms requiring
online training. To address these challenges, this work presents a methodology
based on RGB-D information and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks
(3D CNNs) for MAC autonomous driving in simulated environments. We evaluate the
proposed approach against recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with architectures
trained and tested on two simulated tracks with distinct environmental
features. Performance was assessed using task completion success, lap-time
metrics, and driving consistency. Results highlight how architectural
modifications and track complexity influence the models' generalization
capability and vehicle control performance. The proposed 3D CNN demonstrated
promising results when compared with RNNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决机器人操控中的组合动作空间爆炸、不安全运动规划和系统性组装策略学习等关键挑战

Method: 集成法律动作掩码DQN与层次架构，将Q函数估计分解为方位和位置组件，使用机器人友好奖励函数，通过课程学习在三个难度级别上进行训练

Result: 训练效率显著：等级1在500次迭代内达到100%成功率，等级292.9%，等级339.9%，总训练次数达105,300次

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了复杂操控任务中的算法效率和安全性问题，为自主立方体组装提供了可靠的强化学习解决方案

Abstract: This paper presents the first comprehensive application of legal-action
masked Deep Q-Networks with safe ZYZ regrasp strategies to an underactuated
gripper-equipped 6-DOF collaborative robot for autonomous Soma cube assembly
learning. Our approach represents the first systematic integration of
constraint-aware reinforcement learning with singularity-safe motion planning
on a Doosan M0609 collaborative robot. We address critical challenges in
robotic manipulation: combinatorial action space explosion, unsafe motion
planning, and systematic assembly strategy learning. Our system integrates a
legal-action masked DQN with hierarchical architecture that decomposes
Q-function estimation into orientation and position components, reducing
computational complexity from $O(3,132)$ to $O(116) + O(27)$ while maintaining
solution completeness. The robot-friendly reward function encourages
ground-first, vertically accessible assembly sequences aligned with
manipulation constraints. Curriculum learning across three progressive
difficulty levels (2-piece, 3-piece, 7-piece) achieves remarkable training
efficiency: 100\% success rate for Level 1 within 500 episodes, 92.9\% for
Level 2, and 39.9\% for Level 3 over 105,300 total training episodes.

*Seyed Ali Rakhshan,Mehdi Golestani,He Kong*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于拟阵理论的贪心算法，用于异构传感器（充足感知和有限感知机器人）的多目标跟踪任务分配，保证多项式时间复杂度和常数因子近似比


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决异构传感器（具有不同感知能力的机器人）在多目标跟踪中的分配挑战，优化跟踪质量并最小化目标状态估计的不确定性

Method: 将机器人分类为充足感知机器人（具备距离和方位传感器）和有限感知机器人（仅具备距离或方位传感器），利用拟阵理论设计动态贪心分配算法，最大化跟踪质量

Result: 算法保证1/3（任意跟踪质量函数）和1/2（子模函数）的常数因子近似比，多项式时间复杂，仿真显示能准确长时间跟踪目标，性能接近最优分配

Conclusion: 所提算法在保证计算效率的同时实现了接近最优的跟踪性能，具有鲁棒性和实际应用价值，为异构传感器多目标跟踪提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of assigning heterogeneous sensors (i.e.,
robots with varying sensing capabilities) for multi-target tracking. We
classify robots into two categories: (1) sufficient sensing robots, equipped
with range and bearing sensors, capable of independently tracking targets, and
(2) limited sensing robots, which are equipped with only range or bearing
sensors and need to at least form a pair to collaboratively track a target. Our
objective is to optimize tracking quality by minimizing uncertainty in target
state estimation through efficient robot-to-target assignment. By leveraging
matroid theory, we propose a greedy assignment algorithm that dynamically
allocates robots to targets to maximize tracking quality. The algorithm
guarantees constant-factor approximation bounds of 1/3 for arbitrary tracking
quality functions and 1/2 for submodular functions, while maintaining
polynomial-time complexity. Extensive simulations demonstrate the algorithm's
effectiveness in accurately estimating and tracking targets over extended
periods. Furthermore, numerical results confirm that the algorithm's
performance is close to that of the optimal assignment, highlighting its
robustness and practical applicability.

*Haojie Bai,Yang Wang,Cong Guo,Xiongwei Zhao,Hai Zhu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型车辆协同协调框架，通过分布轨迹控制、并行ADMM算法和交互注意力机制，在保证安全性的同时实现实时性能，碰撞率降低40.79%，计算需求减少14.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决动态不确定环境中车辆协同协调的安全保证和实时性能之间的根本矛盾，特别是在交互轨迹不确定性下的安全保障问题。

Method: 1) 直接控制车辆轨迹分布的鲁棒协同规划方法；2) 完全并行的ADMM分布式轨迹协商算法；3) 选择性关注关键交互参与者的交互注意力机制。

Result: 在各种场景下碰撞率降低达40.79%，计算需求减少14.1%，在车辆数量增加时保持强可扩展性，并在真实世界实验中验证了框架有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了安全性和实时性能的平衡问题，在复杂环境中实现了鲁棒的车辆协同协调，具有显著的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Achieving both safety guarantees and real-time performance in cooperative
vehicle coordination remains a fundamental challenge, particularly in dynamic
and uncertain environments. This paper presents a novel coordination framework
that resolves this challenge through three key innovations: 1) direct control
of vehicles' trajectory distributions during coordination, formulated as a
robust cooperative planning problem with adaptive enhanced safety constraints,
ensuring a specified level of safety regarding the uncertainty of the
interactive trajectory, 2) a fully parallel ADMM-based distributed trajectory
negotiation (ADMM-DTN) algorithm that efficiently solves the optimization
problem while allowing configurable negotiation rounds to balance solution
quality and computational resources, and 3) an interactive attention mechanism
that selectively focuses on critical interactive participants to further
enhance computational efficiency. Both simulation results and practical
experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves significant advantages in
safety (reducing collision rates by up to 40.79\% in various scenarios) and
real-time performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining
strong scalability with increasing vehicle numbers. The proposed interactive
attention mechanism further reduces the computational demand by 14.1\%. The
framework's effectiveness is further validated through real-world experiments
with unexpected dynamic obstacles, demonstrating robust coordination in complex
environments. The experiment demo could be found at

*Alberto Bertipaglia,Dariu M. Gavrila,Barys Shyrokau*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出基于多模态模型预测路径积分控制的新型自动驾驶车辆运动规划方法，通过Sobol序列采样和碰撞避免解析解，在高低摩擦路面和遮挡场景中优于标准方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动驾驶车辆在复杂环境中运动规划可能陷入局部最优解的问题，提高避障能力和车辆稳定性

Method: 使用多模态模型预测路径积分控制算法，结合Sobol序列采样和碰撞避免解析解，采用非线性单轨车辆模型和Fiala轮胎模型，强制执行摩擦圆内的轮胎力约束

Result: 在高保真仿真环境中成功实现障碍物避让，在高低摩擦路面双车道变换和移动障碍物遮挡场景中保持车辆稳定，性能优于标准模型预测路径积分方法

Conclusion: 多模态控制算法能够探索多样化轨迹，有效避免局部最优解，提高自动驾驶车辆在复杂环境中的安全性和稳定性

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach to motion planning and decision-making
for automated vehicles, using a multi-modal Model Predictive Path Integral
control algorithm. The method samples with Sobol sequences around the prior
input and incorporates analytical solutions for collision avoidance. By
leveraging multiple modes, the multi-modal control algorithm explores diverse
trajectories, such as manoeuvring around obstacles or stopping safely before
them, mitigating the risk of sub-optimal solutions. A non-linear single-track
vehicle model with a Fiala tyre serves as the prediction model, and tyre force
constraints within the friction circle are enforced to ensure vehicle stability
during evasive manoeuvres. The optimised steering angle and longitudinal
acceleration are computed to generate a collision-free trajectory and to
control the vehicle. In a high-fidelity simulation environment, we demonstrate
that the proposed algorithm can successfully avoid obstacles, keeping the
vehicle stable while driving a double lane change manoeuvre on high and
low-friction road surfaces and occlusion scenarios with moving obstacles,
outperforming a standard Model Predictive Path Integral approach.

### [11] [Dynamics-Compliant Trajectory Diffusion for Super-Nominal Payload Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21375)
*Anuj Pasricha,Joewie Koh,Jay Vakil,Alessandro Roncone*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于去噪扩散模型的新型轨迹生成方法，能够突破传统保守的额定负载限制，让机器人在大部分工作空间内安全处理3倍于额定负载的载荷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器人额定负载基于最坏情况配置，导致整个工作空间内负载能力被严重低估，无法充分利用机器人固有能力。

Method: 使用去噪扩散模型将负载约束明确纳入规划过程，生成动态可行的关节空间轨迹，无需后处理即可在物理硬件上直接执行。

Result: 在7自由度Franka Emika Panda机器人上的实验验证显示，即使负载超过额定容量3倍，仍有67.6%的工作空间可访问。

Conclusion: 该方法显著扩展了机器人的操作范围，强调了在运动规划算法中更细致考虑负载动力学的重要性。

Abstract: Nominal payload ratings for articulated robots are typically derived from
worst-case configurations, resulting in uniform payload constraints across the
entire workspace. This conservative approach severely underutilizes the robot's
inherent capabilities -- our analysis demonstrates that manipulators can safely
handle payloads well above nominal capacity across broad regions of their
workspace while staying within joint angle, velocity, acceleration, and torque
limits. To address this gap between assumed and actual capability, we propose a
novel trajectory generation approach using denoising diffusion models that
explicitly incorporates payload constraints into the planning process. Unlike
traditional sampling-based methods that rely on inefficient trial-and-error,
optimization-based methods that are prohibitively slow, or kinodynamic planners
that struggle with problem dimensionality, our approach generates dynamically
feasible joint-space trajectories in constant time that can be directly
executed on physical hardware without post-processing. Experimental validation
on a 7 DoF Franka Emika Panda robot demonstrates that up to 67.6% of the
workspace remains accessible even with payloads exceeding 3 times the nominal
capacity. This expanded operational envelope highlights the importance of a
more nuanced consideration of payload dynamics in motion planning algorithms.

### [12] [RoboInspector: Unveiling the Unreliability of Policy Code for LLM-enabled Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21378)
*Chenduo Ying,Linkang Du,Peng Cheng,Yuanchao Shu*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: RoboInspector是一个分析LLM在机器人操作中策略代码生成不可靠性的框架，从任务复杂性和指令粒度两个角度识别了四种主要不可靠行为，并提出基于失败反馈的优化方法，将可靠性提升达35%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM在机器人操作中展现出强大的代码生成能力，但由于现实任务的多样性和用户指令的复杂性，策略代码生成的可靠性仍然是一个重大挑战。不同用户对同一任务可能给出不同的指令，这会导致策略代码生成的不稳定性。

Method: 设计了RoboInspector流水线，从操作任务复杂性和指令粒度两个维度分析策略代码的不可靠性。在两大主流框架中进行了168个任务-指令-LLM组合的全面实验，识别了四种导致操作失败的主要不可靠行为。

Result: 识别了四种主要的不可靠行为，并详细描述了这些行为及其根本原因。通过基于失败策略代码反馈的优化方法，在仿真和真实环境中将策略代码生成的可靠性提升了高达35%。

Conclusion: RoboInspector为理解LLM在机器人操作中策略代码生成的不可靠性提供了系统分析框架，提出的优化方法显著提升了可靠性，为实际开发提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 本文通过几何分析和沟通策略解决社交感知机器人导航中的人机互动问题，提出了人类合作性评估方法和适时沟通策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交感知机器人导航策略虽然有所改善，但当人类行为出现意外时，机器较难理解人类意图和合作性，人类也不清楚机器的规划，导致交互困难。

Method: 基于几何分析的上下文分析和人类合作性评估方法，在头对头交叉场景中实现适时有效沟通，包括语音响应和机器动作生成。

Result: 提出了一套评估方法和指标体系，能够区分合作性与非合作性人类，并展示了如何利用几何推理生成适当的沟通方式。

Conclusion: 通过几何分析和适时沟通策略，可以有效解决社交感知机器人导航中的人机互动问题，提高机器导航效果和人机交互体验。

Abstract: Socially aware robot navigation is a planning paradigm where the robot
navigates in human environments and tries to adhere to social constraints while
interacting with the humans in the scene. These navigation strategies were
further improved using human prediction models, where the robot takes the
potential future trajectory of humans while computing its own. Though these
strategies significantly improve the robot's behavior, it faces difficulties
from time to time when the human behaves in an unexpected manner. This happens
as the robot fails to understand human intentions and cooperativeness, and the
human does not have a clear idea of what the robot is planning to do. In this
paper, we aim to address this gap through effective communication at an
appropriate time based on a geometric analysis of the context and human
cooperativeness in head-on crossing scenarios. We provide an assessment
methodology and propose some evaluation metrics that could distinguish a
cooperative human from a non-cooperative one. Further, we also show how
geometric reasoning can be used to generate appropriate verbal responses or
robot actions.

Conclusion: 基于图的神经符号框架能够捕捉复杂状态转换（包括非空间和时间关系），在有限演示数据集中实现了数据驱动学习或聚类技术难以发现的模式，为模仿学习提供了新的有效途径。

Abstract: Imitation learning enables intelligent systems to acquire complex behaviors
with minimal supervision. However, existing methods often focus on
short-horizon skills, require large datasets, and struggle to solve
long-horizon tasks or generalize across task variations and distribution
shifts. We propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that jointly learns
continuous control policies and symbolic domain abstractions from a few skill
demonstrations. Our method abstracts high-level task structures into a graph,
discovers symbolic rules via an Answer Set Programming solver, and trains
low-level controllers using diffusion policy imitation learning. A high-level
oracle filters task-relevant information to focus each controller on a minimal
observation and action space. Our graph-based neuro-symbolic framework enables
capturing complex state transitions, including non-spatial and temporal
relations, that data-driven learning or clustering techniques often fail to
discover in limited demonstration datasets. We validate our approach in six

Abstract: Path planning in robotics often involves solving continuously valued,
high-dimensional problems. Popular informed approaches include graph-based
searches, such as A*, and sampling-based methods, such as Informed RRT*, which
utilize informed set and anytime strategies to expedite path optimization
incrementally. Informed sampling-based planners define informed sets as subsets
of the problem domain based on the current best solution cost. However, when no
solution is found, these planners re-sample and explore the entire
configuration space, which is time-consuming and computationally expensive.
This article introduces Multi-Informed Trees (MIT*), a novel planner that
constructs estimated informed sets based on prior admissible solution costs
before finding the initial solution, thereby accelerating the initial
convergence rate. Moreover, MIT* employs an adaptive sampler that dynamically
adjusts the sampling strategy based on the exploration process. Furthermore,
MIT* utilizes length-related adaptive sparse collision checks to guide lazy
reverse search. These features enhance path cost efficiency and computation
times while ensuring high success rates in confined scenarios. Through a series
of simulations and real-world experiments, it is confirmed that MIT*
outperforms existing single-query, sampling-based planners for problems in R^4
to R^16 and has been successfully applied to real-world robot manipulation
tasks. A video showcasing our experimental results is available at:

Abstract: Traversing narrow gates presents a significant challenge and has become a
standard benchmark for evaluating agile and precise quadrotor flight.
Traditional modularized autonomous flight stacks require extensive design and
parameter tuning, while end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) methods often
suffer from low sample efficiency and limited interpretability. In this work,
we present a novel hybrid framework that adaptively fine-tunes model predictive
control (MPC) parameters online using outputs from a neural network (NN)
trained offline. The NN jointly predicts a reference pose and cost-function
weights, conditioned on the coordinates of the gate corners and the current
drone state. To achieve efficient training, we derive analytical policy
gradients not only for the MPC module but also for an optimization-based gate
traversal detection module. Furthermore, we introduce a new formulation of the
attitude tracking error that admits a simplified representation, facilitating
effective learning with bounded gradients. Hardware experiments demonstrate
that our method enables fast and accurate quadrotor traversal through narrow
gates in confined environments. It achieves several orders of magnitude
improvement in sample efficiency compared to naive end-to-end RL approaches.

Abstract: We present a multi-modal dataset collected in a soybean crop field,
comprising over two hours of recorded data from sensors such as stereo infrared
camera, color camera, accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, GNSS (Single
Point Positioning, Real-Time Kinematic and Post-Processed Kinematic), and wheel
odometry. This dataset captures key challenges inherent to robotics in
agricultural environments, including variations in natural lighting, motion
blur, rough terrain, and long, perceptually aliased sequences. By addressing
these complexities, the dataset aims to support the development and
benchmarking of advanced algorithms for localization, mapping, perception, and
navigation in agricultural robotics. The platform and data collection system is
designed to meet the key requirements for evaluating multi-modal SLAM systems,
including hardware synchronization of sensors, 6-DOF ground truth and loops on
long trajectories.
  We run multimodal state-of-the art SLAM methods on the dataset, showcasing
the existing limitations in their application on agricultural settings. The

Abstract: Industrial manipulators are normally operated in cluttered environments,
making safe motion planning important. Furthermore, the presence of
model-uncertainties make safe motion planning more difficult. Therefore, in
practice the speed is limited in order to reduce the effect of disturbances.
There is a need for control methods that can guarantee safe motions that can be
executed fast. We address this need by suggesting a novel model predictive
control (MPC) solution for manipulators, where our two main components are a
robust tube MPC and a corridor planning algorithm to obtain collision-free
motion. Our solution results in a convex MPC, which we can solve fast, making
our method practically useful. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in a
simulated environment with a 6 DOF industrial robot operating in cluttered
environments with uncertainties in model parameters. We outperform benchmark
methods, both in terms of being able to work under higher levels of model
uncertainties, while also yielding faster motion.

Abstract: Pedestrians approaching each other on a sidewalk sometimes end up in an
awkward interaction known as the "sidewalk salsa": they both (repeatedly)
deviate to the same side to avoid a collision. This provides an interesting use
case to study interactions between pedestrians and mobile robots because, in
the vast majority of cases, this phenomenon is avoided through a negotiation
based on implicit communication. Understanding how it goes wrong and how
pedestrians end up in the sidewalk salsa will therefore provide insight into
the implicit communication. This understanding can be used to design safe and
acceptable robotic behaviour. In a previous attempt to gain this understanding,
a model of pedestrian behaviour based on the Communication-Enabled Interaction
(CEI) framework was developed that can replicate the sidewalk salsa. However,
it is unclear how to leverage this model in robotic planning and
decision-making since it violates the assumptions of game theory, a much-used
framework in planning and decision-making. Here, we present a proof-of-concept
for an approach where a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent leverages the model
to learn how to interact with pedestrians. The results show that a basic RL
agent successfully learned to interact with the CEI model. Furthermore, a
risk-averse RL agent that had access to the perceived risk of the CEI model
learned how to effectively communicate its intention through its motion and
thereby substantially lowered the perceived risk, and displayed effort by the
modelled pedestrian. These results show this is a promising approach and
encourage further exploration.
