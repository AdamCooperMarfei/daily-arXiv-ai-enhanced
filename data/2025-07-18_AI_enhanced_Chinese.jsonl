This paper studies the problem of Long-term Active Embodied\nQuestion Answering (LA-EQA), a new task in which a robot must both recall past\nexperiences and actively explore its environment to answer complex,\ntemporally-grounded questions. Unlike traditional EQA settings, which typically\nfocus either on understanding the present environment alone or on recalling a\nsingle past observation, LA-EQA challenges an agent to reason over past,\npresent, and possible future states, deciding when to explore, when to consult\nits memory, and when to stop gathering observations and provide a final answer.\nStandard EQA approaches based on large models struggle in this setting due to\nlimited context windows, absence of persistent memory, and an inability to\ncombine memory recall with active exploration. To address this, we propose a\nstructured memory system for robots, inspired by the mind palace method from\ncognitive science. Our method encodes episodic experiences as scene-graph-based\nworld instances, forming a reasoning and planning algorithm that enables\ntargeted memory retrieval and guided navigation.

In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based training\nscheme for diffusion motion planning models, enabling them to effectively learn\nnon-differentiable objectives that explicitly measure safety and effectiveness.\nSpecifically, we introduce a reward-weighted dynamic thresholding algorithm to\nshape a dense reward signal, facilitating more effective training and\noutperforming models trained with differentiable objectives. State-of-the-art\nperformance on pedestrian datasets (CrowdNav, ETH-UCY) compared to various\nbaselines demonstrates the versatility of our approach for safe and effective\nmotion planning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f18\u5316\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\uff09\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u4f18\u5316\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u78b0\u649e\u907f\u514d\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u8fbe\u6210\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u5956\u52b1\u52a0\u6743\u52a8\u6001\u9608\u503c\u7b97\u6cd5\u4ee5\u4f18\u5316\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u884c\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08CrowdNav, ETH-UCY\uff09\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8fd0\u52a8\u89c4\u5212\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002"}}

This not only affects the control performance, but\nalso increases the difficulty of designing MPC cost functions that reflect the\ndesired long-term objective. This paper proposes ZipMPC, a method that imitates\na long-horizon MPC behaviour by learning a compressed and context-dependent\ncost function for a short-horizon MPC. It improves performance over alternative\nmethods, such as approximate explicit MPC and automatic cost parameter tuning,\nin particular in terms of i) optimizing the long term objective; ii)\nmaintaining computational costs comparable to a short-horizon MPC; iii)\nensuring constraint satisfaction; and iv) generalizing control behaviour to\nenvironments not observed during training. For this purpose, ZipMPC leverages\nthe concept of differentiable MPC with neural networks to propagate gradients\nof the imitation loss through the MPC optimization. We validate our proposed\nmethod in simulation and real-world experiments on autonomous racing.

It also seeks to expand research into medical 'pets', including\nrobotic guide and alert dogs.\n  A comparative analysis of thirteen related research papers shaped key\nevaluation criteria, including collision detection, pathfinding algorithms,\nsensor usage, robot type, and simulation platforms. The study focuses on sensor\ninputs, collision frequency, reward signals, and learning progression to\ndetermine which algorithm best supports robotic navigation in complex\nenvironments.\n  Custom-made environments were used to ensure fair evaluation of all three\nalgorithms under controlled conditions, allowing consistent data collection.\nResults show that Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) outperformed Deep\nQ-Network (DQN) and Q-learning across all metrics, particularly in average and\nmedian steps to goal per episode.\n  By analysing these results, this study contributes to robotic navigation, AI\nand medical robotics, offering insights into the feasibility of AI-driven\nquadruped mobility and its role in assistive robotics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\uff08PPO\u3001DQN\u3001Q-learning\uff09\u5728\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u907f\u969c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0PPO\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f18\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u76f2\u72ac\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8AI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7edf\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e09\u79cd\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u8f93\u5165\u3001\u78b0\u649e\u9891\u7387\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "result": "PPO\u5728\u5bfc\u822a\u548c\u907f\u969c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8eDQN\u548cQ-learning\u3002", "conclusion": "PPO\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u56db\u8db3\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u8f85\u52a9\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, the performance of these policies is heavily\ndependent on the number of training demonstrations, which requires expensive\ndata collection in the real world. In this work, we aim to reduce data\ncollection efforts when learning visuomotor robot policies by leveraging\nexisting or cost-effective data from a wide range of embodiments, such as\npublic robot datasets and the datasets of humans playing with objects (human\ndata from play). Our approach leverages two key insights. First, we use optic\nflow as an embodiment-agnostic action representation to train a World Model\n(WM) across multi-embodiment datasets, and finetune it on a small amount of\nrobot data from the target embodiment. Second, we develop a method, Latent\nPolicy Steering (LPS), to improve the output of a behavior-cloned policy by\nsearching in the latent space of the WM for better action sequences. In real\nworld experiments, we observe significant improvements in the performance of\npolicies trained with a small amount of data (over 50% relative improvement\nwith 30 demonstrations and over 20% relative improvement with 50\ndemonstrations) by combining the policy with a WM pretrained on two thousand\nepisodes sampled from the existing Open X-embodiment dataset across different\nrobots or a cost-effective human dataset from play.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6a21\u4eff\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u6548\u679c\u663e\u8457\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u3002\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5f00\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u73a9\u800d\u6570\u636e\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f53\u73b0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u51cf\u5c11\u5b66\u4e60\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b56\u7565\u65f6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u6216\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u6570\u636e\uff08\u5982\u516c\u5f00\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4eba\u7c7b\u73a9\u800d\u6570\u636e\uff09\u63d0\u5347\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5149\u6d41\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f53\u73b0\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\uff08WM\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u76ee\u6807\u4f53\u73b0\u7684\u5c0f\u91cf\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u5fae\u8c03\u30022. \u5f00\u53d1\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\uff08LPS\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u641c\u7d22\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u5e8f\u5217\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u884c\u4e3a\u514b\u9686\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5c0f\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\uff0830\u6b21\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534750%\uff0c50\u6b21\u6f14\u793a\u76f8\u5bf9\u63d0\u534720%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u591a\u4f53\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u548c\u6f5c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u5f15\u5bfc\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\u9700\u6c42\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}
