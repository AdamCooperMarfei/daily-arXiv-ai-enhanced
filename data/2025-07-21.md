### [1] [Hard-Stop Synthesis for Multi-DOF Compliant Mechanisms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13455)
*Dean Chen,Armin Pomeroy,Brandon T. Peterson,Will Flanagan,He Kai Lim,Alexandra Stavrakis,Nelson F. SooHoo,Jonathan B. Hopkins,Tyler R. Clites*

TL;DR: 提出了一种系统性设计方法，通过集成多自由度运动限制的紧凑硬止动表面，为柔性机构提供过载保护，确保其在弹性范围内工作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 柔性机构在精密应用中潜力巨大，但因疲劳和机械故障的固有脆弱性，难以在实际环境中应用。复杂和不确定的负载环境进一步增加了挑战。

Method: 引入理论和实践框架，优化接触表面几何形状，以最大化机构的多自由度工作空间，同时确保其保持在弹性范围内。

Result: 通过骨科植入物的案例研究，数值和实验验证了设计能可靠防止疲劳、屈服和屈曲。

Conclusion: 为在不确定负载下工作的柔性系统提供了精密硬止动设计的基础，推动了柔性机构在实际系统中的应用。

Abstract: Compliant mechanisms have significant potential in precision applications due
to their ability to guide motion without contact. However, an inherent
vulnerability to fatigue and mechanical failure has hindered the translation of
compliant mechanisms to real-world applications. This is particularly
challenging in service environments where loading is complex and uncertain, and
the cost of failure is high. In such cases, mechanical hard stops are critical
to prevent yielding and buckling. Conventional hard-stop designs, which rely on
stacking single-DOF limits, must be overly restrictive in multi-DOF space to
guarantee safety in the presence of unknown loads. In this study, we present a
systematic design synthesis method to guarantee overload protection in
compliant mechanisms by integrating coupled multi-DOF motion limits within a
single pair of compact hard-stop surfaces. Specifically, we introduce a
theoretical and practical framework for optimizing the contact surface geometry
to maximize the mechanisms multi-DOF working space while still ensuring that
the mechanism remains within its elastic regime. We apply this synthesis method
to a case study of a caged-hinge mechanism for orthopaedic implants, and
provide numerical and experimental validation that the derived design offers
reliable protection against fatigue, yielding, and buckling. This work
establishes a foundation for precision hard-stop design in compliant systems
operating under uncertain loads, which is a crucial step toward enabling the
application of compliant mechanisms in real-world systems.

Abstract: The integration of large language models (LLMs) into conversational robots
has made human-robot conversations more dynamic. Yet, LLM-powered
conversational robots remain prone to errors, e.g., misunderstanding user
intent, prematurely interrupting users, or failing to respond altogether.
Detecting and addressing these failures is critical for preventing
conversational breakdowns, avoiding task disruptions, and sustaining user
trust. To tackle this problem, the ERR@HRI 2.0 Challenge provides a multimodal
dataset of LLM-powered conversational robot failures during human-robot
conversations and encourages researchers to benchmark machine learning models
designed to detect robot failures. The dataset includes 16 hours of dyadic
human-robot interactions, incorporating facial, speech, and head movement
features. Each interaction is annotated with the presence or absence of robot
errors from the system perspective, and perceived user intention to correct for
a mismatch between robot behavior and user expectation. Participants are
invited to form teams and develop machine learning models that detect these
failures using multimodal data. Submissions will be evaluated using various
performance metrics, including detection accuracy and false positive rate. This
challenge represents another key step toward improving failure detection in
human-robot interaction through social signal analysis.

### [3] [SCOPE for Hexapod Gait Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13539)
*Jim O'Connor,Jay B. Nash,Derin Gezgin,Gary B. Parker*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: SCOPE方法通过离散余弦变换（DCT）压缩输入数据，显著提升六足机器人步态学习的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决进化算法在复杂输入空间下性能下降的问题。

Method: 利用DCT截断输入矩阵的特征系数，降低输入维度。

Result: 输入数据从2700减少到54，效率提升20%。

Conclusion: SCOPE能显著压缩输入数据并提升控制器性能。

Abstract: Evolutionary methods have previously been shown to be an effective learning
method for walking gaits on hexapod robots. However, the ability of these
algorithms to evolve an effective policy rapidly degrades as the input space
becomes more complex. This degradation is due to the exponential growth of the
solution space, resulting from an increasing parameter count to handle a more
complex input. In order to address this challenge, we introduce Sparse Cosine
Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine
Transform (DCT) to learn directly from the feature coefficients of an input
matrix. By truncating the coefficient matrix returned by the DCT, we can reduce
the dimensionality of an input while retaining the highest energy features of
the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by using
SCOPE to learn the gait of a hexapod robot. The hexapod controller is given a
matrix input containing time-series information of previous poses, which are
then transformed to gait parameters by an evolved policy. In this task, the
addition of SCOPE to a reference algorithm achieves a 20% increase in efficacy.
SCOPE achieves this result by reducing the total input size of the time-series
pose data from 2700 to 54, a 98% decrease. Additionally, SCOPE is capable of
compressing an input to any output shape, provided that each output dimension
is no greater than the corresponding input dimension. This paper demonstrates
that SCOPE is capable of significantly compressing the size of an input to an
evolved controller, resulting in a statistically significant gain in efficacy.

Abstract: In this work we extend the low-cost GELLO teleoperation system, initially
designed for joint position control, with additional force information. Our
first extension is to implement force feedback, allowing users to feel
resistance when interacting with the environment. Our second extension is to
add force information into the data collection process and training of
imitation learning models. We validate our additions by implementing these on a
GELLO system with a Franka Panda arm as the follower robot, performing a user
study, and comparing the performance of policies trained with and without force
information on a range of simulated and real dexterous manipulation tasks.
Qualitatively, users with robotics experience preferred our controller, and the
addition of force inputs improved task success on the majority of tasks.

### [5] [Improved particle swarm optimization algorithm: multi-target trajectory optimization for swarm drones](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13647)
*Minze Li,Wei Zhao,Ran Chen,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种改进的粒子群优化（PE-PSO）方法，用于无人机（UAV）在动态环境中的实时轨迹规划，解决了传统PSO的过早收敛和延迟问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中无人机实时轨迹规划的计算需求高且需要快速响应，传统PSO方法在实时场景中表现不佳。

Result: 仿真表明，PE-PSO在轨迹质量、能效、避障和计算时间上优于传统PSO和其他群智能规划器。

Conclusion: PE-PSO适用于复杂环境下的实时多无人机操作，具有高效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Real-time trajectory planning for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in dynamic
environments remains a key challenge due to high computational demands and the
need for fast, adaptive responses. Traditional Particle Swarm Optimization
(PSO) methods, while effective for offline planning, often struggle with
premature convergence and latency in real-time scenarios. To overcome these
limitations, we propose PE-PSO, an enhanced PSO-based online trajectory
planner. The method introduces a persistent exploration mechanism to preserve
swarm diversity and an entropy-based parameter adjustment strategy to
dynamically adapt optimization behavior. UAV trajectories are modeled using
B-spline curves, which ensure path smoothness while reducing optimization
complexity. To extend this capability to UAV swarms, we develop a multi-agent
framework that combines genetic algorithm (GA)-based task allocation with
distributed PE-PSO, supporting scalable and coordinated trajectory generation.
The distributed architecture allows for parallel computation and decentralized
control, enabling effective cooperation among agents while maintaining
real-time performance. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework outperforms conventional PSO and other swarm-based planners across
several metrics, including trajectory quality, energy efficiency, obstacle
avoidance, and computation time. These results confirm the effectiveness and
applicability of PE-PSO in real-time multi-UAV operations under complex
environmental conditions.

Conclusion: 该机器人系统能够有效提高囊膜清洁手术的精度和安全性，为临床治疗提供了新方法。

Abstract: Secondary cataract is one of the most common complications of vision loss due
to the proliferation of residual lens materials that naturally grow on the lens
capsule after cataract surgery. A potential treatment is capsule cleaning, a
surgical procedure that requires enhanced visualization of the entire capsule
and tool manipulation on the thin membrane. This article presents a robotic
system capable of performing the capsule cleaning procedure by integrating a
standard transpupillary and an intraocular optical coherence tomography probe
on a surgical instrument for equatorial capsule visualization and real-time
tool-to-tissue distance feedback. Using robot precision, the developed system
enables complete capsule mapping in the pupillary and equatorial regions with
in-situ calibration of refractive index and fiber offset, which are still
current challenges in obtaining an accurate capsule model. To demonstrate
effectiveness, the capsule mapping strategy was validated through five
experimental trials on an eye phantom that showed reduced root-mean-square
errors in the constructed capsule model, while the cleaning strategy was
performed in three ex-vivo pig eyes without tissue damage.

Method: 使用IRISS远程手术系统，将模拟显微镜视图投影到VR头显，由5名经验丰富的玻璃体视网膜外科医生和5名无手术经验的工程师完成手术任务。

Result: 高缩放因子的Inside Control模式整体表现最佳，但最佳缩放因子因任务和复杂度而异。

Conclusion: 优化控制方法和缩放因子可提升手术效率和准确性，减少未来机器人辅助眼内手术的风险。

Abstract: This paper examines the performance of Inside and Outside Control modes at
various scaling factors in a simulated vitreoretinal surgical setting. The
IRISS teleoperated surgical system's console (cockpit) was adapted to project a
simulated microscope view of an intraocular setup to a virtual reality (VR)
headset. Five experienced vitreoretinal surgeons and five engineers with no
surgical experience used the system to perform tasks common to vitreoretinal
surgery. Experimental results indicate that Inside Control methods at higher
scaling factors (20 or 30) achieved the best performance overall, though the
optimal scaling factor may vary by task and complexity. Optimizing control
methods and scaling factors could lead to improvements in surgical efficiency
and accuracy, as well as minimize risks in future robotic-assisted intraocular
procedures.

Conclusion: ILC与扭矩库的结合为腿式机器人在非结构化动态环境中提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a scalable and adaptive control framework for legged
robots that integrates Iterative Learning Control (ILC) with a biologically
inspired torque library (TL), analogous to muscle memory. The proposed method
addresses key challenges in robotic locomotion, including accurate trajectory
tracking under unmodeled dynamics and external disturbances. By leveraging the
repetitive nature of periodic gaits and extending ILC to nonperiodic tasks, the
framework enhances accuracy and generalization across diverse locomotion
scenarios. The control architecture is data-enabled, combining a physics-based
model derived from hybrid-system trajectory optimization with real-time
learning to compensate for model uncertainties and external disturbances. A
central contribution is the development of a generalized TL that stores learned
control profiles and enables rapid adaptation to changes in speed, terrain, and
gravitational conditions-eliminating the need for repeated learning and
significantly reducing online computation. The approach is validated on the
bipedal robot Cassie and the quadrupedal robot A1 through extensive simulations
and hardware experiments. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework
reduces joint tracking errors by up to 85% within a few seconds and enables
reliable execution of both periodic and nonperiodic gaits, including slope
traversal and terrain adaptation. Compared to state-of-the-art whole-body
controllers, the learned skills eliminate the need for online computation
during execution and achieve control update rates exceeding 30x those of
existing methods. These findings highlight the effectiveness of integrating ILC
with torque memory as a highly data-efficient and practical solution for legged
locomotion in unstructured and dynamic environments.

Abstract: Multi-robot localization is a crucial task for implementing multi-robot
systems. Numerous researchers have proposed optimization-based multi-robot
localization methods that use camera, IMU, and UWB sensors. Nevertheless,
characteristics of individual robot odometry estimates and distance
measurements between robots used in the optimization are not sufficiently
considered. In addition, previous researches were heavily influenced by the
odometry accuracy that is estimated from individual robots. Consequently,
long-term drift error caused by error accumulation is potentially inevitable.
In this paper, we propose a novel visual-inertial-range-based multi-robot
localization method, named SaWa-ML, which enables geometric structure-aware
pose correction and weight adaptation-based robust multi-robot localization.
Our contributions are twofold: (i) we leverage UWB sensor data, whose range
error does not accumulate over time, to first estimate the relative positions
between robots and then correct the positions of each robot, thus reducing
long-term drift errors, (ii) we design adaptive weights for robot pose
correction by considering the characteristics of the sensor data and
visual-inertial odometry estimates. The proposed method has been validated in
real-world experiments, showing a substantial performance increase compared
with state-of-the-art algorithms.

Abstract: Rare, yet critical, scenarios pose a significant challenge in testing and
evaluating autonomous driving planners. Relying solely on real-world driving
scenes requires collecting massive datasets to capture these scenarios. While
automatic generation of traffic scenarios appears promising, data-driven models
require extensive training data and often lack fine-grained control over the
output. Moreover, generating novel scenarios from scratch can introduce a
distributional shift from the original training scenes which undermines the
validity of evaluations especially for learning-based planners. To sidestep
this, recent work proposes to generate challenging scenarios by augmenting
original scenarios from the test set. However, this involves the manual
augmentation of scenarios by domain experts. An approach that is unable to meet
the demands for scale in the evaluation of self-driving systems. Therefore,
this paper introduces a novel LLM-agent based framework for augmenting
real-world traffic scenarios using natural language descriptions, addressing
the limitations of existing methods. A key innovation is the use of an agentic
design, enabling fine-grained control over the output and maintaining high
performance even with smaller, cost-effective LLMs. Extensive human expert
evaluation demonstrates our framework's ability to accurately adhere to user
intent, generating high quality augmented scenarios comparable to those created
manually.

tasks. The obtained results are used to select the architecture which fit the
required design criteria and will be used to develop the experimental model of
the surgical robot.

Abstract: Synthesising safe controllers from visual data typically requires extensive
supervised labelling of safety-critical data, which is often impractical in
real-world settings. Recent advances in world models enable reliable prediction
in latent spaces, opening new avenues for scalable and data-efficient safe
control. In this work, we introduce a semi-supervised framework that leverages
control barrier certificates (CBCs) learned in the latent space of a world
model to synthesise safe visuomotor policies. Our approach jointly learns a
neural barrier function and a safe controller using limited labelled data,
while exploiting the predictive power of modern vision transformers for latent
dynamics modelling.

Abstract: Autonomous aerial systems play an increasingly vital role in a wide range of
applications, particularly for transport and delivery tasks in complex
environments. In airdrop missions, these platforms face the dual challenges of
abrupt control mode switching and inherent system delays along with control
errors. To address these issues, this paper presents an autonomous airdrop
system based on an aerial manipulator (AM). The introduction of additional
actuated degrees of freedom enables active compensation for UAV tracking
errors. By imposing smooth and continuous constraints on the parabolic landing
point, the proposed approach generates aerial throwing trajectories that are
less sensitive to the timing of payload release. A hierarchical disturbance
compensation strategy is incorporated into the Nonlinear Model Predictive
Control (NMPC) framework to mitigate the effects of sudden changes in system
parameters, while the predictive capabilities of NMPC are further exploited to
improve the precision of aerial throwing. Both simulation and real-world
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves greater
agility and precision in airdrop missions.

Abstract: Safe Multi-Agent Motion Planning (MAMP) is a significant challenge in
robotics. Despite substantial advancements, existing methods often face a
dilemma. Decentralized algorithms typically rely on predicting the behavior of
other agents, sharing contracts, or maintaining communication for safety, while
centralized approaches struggle with scalability and real-time decision-making.
To address these challenges, we introduce Neural Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability
Learning (HJR) for Decentralized Multi-Agent Motion Planning. Our method
provides scalable neural HJR modeling to tackle high-dimensional configuration
spaces and capture worst-case collision and safety constraints between agents.
We further propose a decentralized trajectory optimization framework that
incorporates the learned HJR solutions to solve MAMP tasks in real-time. We
demonstrate that our method is both scalable and data-efficient, enabling the
solution of MAMP problems in higher-dimensional scenarios with complex
collision constraints. Our approach generalizes across various dynamical
systems, including a 12-dimensional dual-arm setup, and outperforms a range of
state-of-the-art techniques in successfully addressing challenging MAMP tasks.

Abstract: The deployment of simple emergent behaviors in swarm robotics has been
well-rehearsed in the literature. A recent study has shown how self-aggregation
is possible in a multitask approach -- where multiple self-aggregation task
instances occur concurrently in the same environment. The multitask approach
poses new challenges, in special, how the dynamic of each group impacts the
performance of others. So far, the multitask self-aggregation of groups of
robots suffers from generating a circular formation -- that is not fully
compact -- or is not fully autonomous. In this paper, we present a multitask
self-aggregation where groups of homogeneous robots sort themselves into
different compact clusters, relying solely on a line-of-sight sensor. Our
multitask self-aggregation behavior was able to scale well and achieve a
compact formation. We report scalability results from a series of simulation
trials with different configurations in the number of groups and the number of
robots per group. We were able to improve the multitask self-aggregation
behavior performance in terms of the compactness of the clusters, keeping the
proportion of clustered robots found in other studies.

Abstract: Robotic grasping, the ability of robots to reliably secure and manipulate
objects of varying shapes, sizes and orientations, is a complex task that
requires precise perception and control. Deep neural networks have shown
remarkable success in grasp synthesis by learning rich and abstract
representations of objects. When deployed at the edge, these models can enable
low-latency, low-power inference, making real-time grasping feasible in
resource-constrained environments. This work implements Heatmap-Guided Grasp
Detection, an end-to-end framework for the detection of 6-Dof grasp poses, on
the GAP9 RISC-V System-on-Chip. The model is optimised using hardware-aware
techniques, including input dimensionality reduction, model partitioning, and
quantisation. Experimental evaluation on the GraspNet-1Billion benchmark
validates the feasibility of fully on-chip inference, highlighting the
potential of low-power MCUs for real-time, autonomous manipulation.

Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms have gained widespread application across various
fields owing to their ability to generate diverse solutions. One such algorithm
is the Snake Optimizer (SO), a progressive optimization approach. However, SO
suffers from the issues of slow convergence speed and susceptibility to local
optima. In light of these shortcomings, we propose a novel Multi-strategy
Improved Snake Optimizer (MISO). Firstly, we propose a new adaptive random
disturbance strategy based on sine function to alleviate the risk of getting
trapped in a local optimum. Secondly, we introduce adaptive Levy flight
strategy based on scale factor and leader and endow the male snake leader with
flight capability, which makes it easier for the algorithm to leap out of the
local optimum and find the global optimum. More importantly, we put forward a
position update strategy combining elite leadership and Brownian motion,
effectively accelerating the convergence speed while ensuring precision.
Finally, to demonstrate the performance of MISO, we utilize 30 CEC2017 test
functions and the CEC2022 test suite, comparing it with 11 popular algorithms
across different dimensions to validate its effectiveness. Moreover, Unmanned
Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has been widely used in various fields due to its
advantages of low cost, high mobility and easy operation. However, the UAV path
planning problem is crucial for flight safety and efficiency, and there are
still challenges in establishing and optimizing the path model. Therefore, we
apply MISO to the UAV 3D path planning problem as well as 6 engineering design
problems to assess its feasibility in practical applications. The experimental
results demonstrate that MISO exceeds other competitive algorithms in terms of
solution quality and stability, establishing its strong potential for
application.

Conclusion: EVLA为边缘设备上的实时视觉-语言-动作任务提供了高效解决方案，并开源了模型和代码以促进研究。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising approach to address
the data scarcity challenge in robotics, enabling the development of
generalizable visuomotor control policies. While models like OpenVLA showcase
the potential of this paradigm, deploying large-scale VLMs on
resource-constrained mobile manipulation systems remains a significant hurdle.
This paper introduces Edge VLA (EVLA), a novel approach designed to
significantly enhance the inference speed of Vision-Language-Action (VLA)
models. EVLA maintains the representational power of these models while
enabling real-time performance on edge devices. We achieve this through two key
innovations: 1) Eliminating the autoregressive requirement for end-effector
position prediction, leading to a 7x speedup in inference, and 2) Leveraging
the efficiency of Small Language Models (SLMs), demonstrating comparable
training performance to larger models with significantly reduced computational
demands. Our early results demonstrate that EVLA achieves comparable training
characteristics to OpenVLA while offering substantial gains in inference speed
and memory efficiency. We release our model checkpoints and training

research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为支持"新太空"商业生态系统中空间硬件的组装和重复使用，需要自主机器人进行监控和维护。

Abstract: The use of autonomous robots in space is an essential part of the "New Space"
commercial ecosystem of assembly and re-use of space hardware components in
Earth orbit and beyond. The STARFAB project aims to create a ground
demonstration of an orbital automated warehouse as a hub for sustainable
commercial operations and servicing. A critical part of this fully-autonomous
robotic facility will be the capability to monitor, inspect, and assess the
condition of both the components stored in the warehouse, and the STARFAB
facility itself. This paper introduces ongoing work on the STARFAB Mobile
Inspection Module (MIM). The MIM uses Standard Interconnects (SI) so that it
can be carried by Walking Manipulators (WM) as an independently-mobile robot,
and multiple MIMs can be stored and retrieved as needed for operations on
STARFAB. The MIM carries high-resolution cameras, a 3D profilometer, and a
thermal imaging sensor, with the capability to add other modular sensors. A
grasping tool and torque wrench are stored within the modular body for use by
an attached WM for maintenance operations. Implementation and testing is still
ongoing at the time of writing. This paper details the concept of operations
for the MIM as an on-orbit autonomous inspection and maintenance system, the
mechanical and electronic design of the MIM, and the sensors package used for
non-destructive testing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器人系统将物理形态视为固定约束，无法适应多样化任务需求。

Conclusion: 动态调整几何表示使机器人能更灵活地适应任务需求，提升性能。

Abstract: What if a robot could rethink its own morphological representation to better
meet the demands of diverse tasks? Most robotic systems today treat their
physical form as a fixed constraint rather than an adaptive resource, forcing
the same rigid geometric representation to serve applications with vastly
different computational and precision requirements. We introduce MorphIt, a
novel algorithm for approximating robot morphology using spherical primitives
that balances geometric accuracy with computational efficiency. Unlike existing
approaches that rely on either labor-intensive manual specification or
inflexible computational methods, MorphIt implements an automatic
gradient-based optimization framework with tunable parameters that provides
explicit control over the physical fidelity versus computational cost tradeoff.
Quantitative evaluations demonstrate that MorphIt outperforms baseline
approaches (Variational Sphere Set Approximation and Adaptive Medial-Axis
Approximation) across multiple metrics, achieving better mesh approximation
with fewer spheres and reduced computational overhead. Our experiments show
enhanced robot capabilities in collision detection accuracy, contact-rich
interaction simulation, and navigation through confined spaces. By dynamically
adapting geometric representations to task requirements, robots can now exploit
their physical embodiment as an active resource rather than an inflexible
parameter, opening new frontiers for manipulation in environments where
physical form must continuously balance precision with computational
tractability.

Abstract: Autonomous motion planning is critical for efficient and safe underwater
manipulation in dynamic marine environments. Current motion planning methods
often fail to effectively utilize prior motion experiences and adapt to
real-time uncertainties inherent in underwater settings. In this paper, we
introduce an Adaptive Heuristic Motion Planner framework that integrates a
Heuristic Motion Space (HMS) with Bayesian Networks to enhance motion planning
for autonomous underwater manipulation. Our approach employs the Probabilistic
Roadmap (PRM) algorithm within HMS to optimize paths by minimizing a composite
cost function that accounts for distance, uncertainty, energy consumption, and
execution time. By leveraging HMS, our framework significantly reduces the
search space, thereby boosting computational performance and enabling real-time
planning capabilities. Bayesian Networks are utilized to dynamically update
uncertainty estimates based on real-time sensor data and environmental
conditions, thereby refining the joint probability of path success. Through
extensive simulations and real-world test scenarios, we showcase the advantages
of our method in terms of enhanced performance and robustness. This
probabilistic approach significantly advances the capability of autonomous
underwater robots, ensuring optimized motion planning in the face of dynamic
marine challenges.
