Under review", "summary": "The online fusion and tracking of static objects from heterogeneous sensor detections is a fundamental problem in robotics, autonomous systems, and environmental mapping. Although classical data association approaches such as JPDA are well suited for dynamic targets, they are less effective for static objects observed intermittently and with heterogeneous uncertainties, where motion models provide minimal discriminative with respect to clutter. In this paper, we propose a novel method for static object data association by clustering multi-modal sensor detections online (SODA-CitrON), while simultaneously estimating positions and maintaining persistent tracks for an unknown number of objects. The proposed unsupervised machine learning approach operates in a fully online manner and handles temporally uncorrelated and multi-sensor measurements. Additionally, it has a worst-case loglinear complexity in the number of sensor detections while providing full output explainability. We evaluate the proposed approach in different Monte Carlo simulation scenarios and compare it against state-of-the-art methods, including Bayesian filtering, DBSTREAM clustering, and JPDA. The results demonstrate that SODA-CitrON consistently outperforms the compared methods in terms of F1 score, position RMSE, MOTP, and MOTA in the static object mapping scenarios studied."}

For such robots, interaction understanding is not primarily a fine-grained recognition problem, but a perception problem under limited sensing quality and computational resources. Many existing approaches focus on holistic group activity recognition, which often requires complex and large models which may not be necessary for mobile service robots. Others use pairwise interaction methods which commonly rely on skeletal representations but their use in outdoor environments remains challenging. In this work, we argue that pairwise human interaction constitute a minimal yet sufficient perceptual unit for robot-centric social understanding. We study the problem of identifying interacting person pairs and classifying coarse-grained interaction behaviors sufficient for downstream group-level reasoning and service robot decision-making. To this end, we adopt a two-stage framework in which candidate interacting pairs are first identified based on lightweight geometric and motion cues, and interaction types are subsequently classified using a relation network. We evaluate the proposed approach on the JRDB dataset, where it achieves sufficient accuracy with reduced computational cost and model size compared to appearance-based methods. Additional experiments on the Collective Activity Dataset and zero shot test on a lawnmower-collected dataset further illustrate the generality of the proposed framework. These results suggest that pairwise geometric and motion cues provide a practical basis for interaction perception on mobile service robot providing a promising method for integration into mobile robot navigation stacks in future work.

However, trajectory planning for such systems remains an open challenge because the problem lies in a high-dimensional, constraint-rich space where collision avoidance must be addressed together with kinematic limits and dynamic feasibility. This work introduces a hierarchical trajectory planning framework that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization. First, we exploit the dual nature of these robots - the root link as a rigid body for guidance and the articulated joints for flexibility - to generate global anchor states that decompose the planning problem into tractable segments. Second, we design a local trajectory planner that optimizes each segment in parallel with differentiable objectives and constraints, systematically enforcing kinematic feasibility and maintaining dynamic feasibility by avoiding control singularities. Third, we implement a complete system that directly processes point-cloud data, eliminating the need for handcrafted obstacle models. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments confirm that this framework enables an articulated aerial robot to exploit its morphology for maneuvering that rigid robots cannot achieve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first planning framework for floating-base multi-link robots that has been demonstrated on a real robot to generate continuous, collision-free, and dynamically feasible trajectories directly from raw point-cloud inputs, without relying on handcrafted obstacle models."}

We propose EgoAVFlow, which learns manipulation and active vision from egocentric videos through a shared 3D flow representation that supports geometric visibility reasoning and transfers without robot demonstrations. EgoAVFlow uses diffusion models to predict robot actions, future 3D flow, and camera trajectories, and refines viewpoints at test time with reward-maximizing denoising under a visibility-aware reward computed from predicted motion and scene geometry. Real-world experiments under actively changing viewpoints show that EgoAVFlow consistently outperforms prior human-demo-based baselines, demonstrating effective visibility maintenance and robust manipulation without robot demonstrations."}

While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are promising general-purpose verifiers due to their reasoning capabilities, existing frameworks often assume these models are well-calibrated. In practice, the overconfident judgment from VLM can degrade the steering performance under both high-level semantic uncertainty in task specifications and low-level action uncertainty or incapability of the pre-trained policy. We propose uncertainty-aware policy steering (UPS), a framework that jointly reasons about semantic task uncertainty and low-level action feasibility, and selects an uncertainty resolution strategy: execute a high-confidence action, clarify task ambiguity via natural language queries, or ask for action interventions to correct the low-level policy when it is deemed incapable at the task. We leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the composition of the VLM and the pre-trained base policy, providing statistical assurances that the verifier selects the correct strategy. After collecting interventions during deployment, we employ residual learning to improve the capability of the pre-trained policy, enabling the system to learn continually but with minimal expensive human feedback. We demonstrate our framework through experiments in simulation and on hardware, showing that UPS can disentangle confident, ambiguous, and incapable scenarios and minimizes expensive user interventions compared to uncalibrated baselines and prior human- or robot-gated continual learning approaches.

Unlike conventional approaches that rely on gloss annotations as intermediate supervision, the proposed system adopts a gloss-free paradigm and directly maps visual sign gestures to semantic instructions. This design reduces annotation cost and avoids the information loss introduced by gloss representations, enabling more natural and scalable multimodal interaction.\n  In this work, we focus on a real-time alphabet-level finger-spelling interface that provides a robust and low-latency communication channel for robotic control. Compared with large-scale continuous sign language recognition, alphabet-level interaction offers improved reliability, interpretability, and deployment feasibility in safety-critical embodied environments. The proposed pipeline transforms continuous gesture streams into coherent language commands through geometric normalization, temporal smoothing, and lexical refinement, ensuring stable and consistent interaction.\n  Furthermore, the framework is designed to support future integration of transformer-based gloss-free sign language models, enabling scalable word-level and sentence-level semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in grounding sign-derived instructions into precise robotic actions under diverse interaction scenarios. These results highlight the potential of the framework to advance accessible, scalable, and multimodal embodied intelligence."}

These systems face the test oracle problem from multiple perspectives. On the one hand, a test oracle must be defined for each instruction prompt, which is a complex and non-generalizable approach. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art oracles typically capture symbolic representations of the world (e.g., robot and object states), enabling the correctness evaluation of a task, but fail to assess other critical aspects, such as the quality with which VLA-enabled robots perform a task. In this paper, we explore whether Metamorphic Testing (MT) can alleviate the test oracle problem in this context. To do so, we propose two metamorphic relation patterns and five metamorphic relations to assess whether changes to the test inputs impact the original trajectory of the VLA-enabled robots. An empirical study involving five VLA models, two simulated robots, and four robotic tasks shows that MT can effectively alleviate the test oracle problem by automatically detecting diverse types of failures, including, but not limited to, uncompleted tasks. More importantly, the proposed MRs are generalizable, making the proposed approach applicable across different VLA models, robots, and tasks, even in the absence of test oracles."}

We explore family routines as a critical entry point for understanding how robots might find a sustainable role in everyday family settings. Together with each of the ten families, we co-designed robot interactions and behaviors, and a plan for the robot to support their chosen routines, accounting for contextual factors such as timing, participants, locations, and the activities in the environment. We then designed, prototyped, and deployed a mobile social robot as a four-day, in-home user study. Families welcomed the robot's reminders, with parents especially appreciating the offloading of some reminding tasks. At the same time, interviews revealed tensions around timing, authority, and family dynamics, highlighting the complexity of integrating robots into households beyond the immediate task of reminders. Based on these insights, we offer design implications for robot-facilitated contextual reminders and discuss broader considerations for designing robots for family settings."}

To improve the practicality of VLAs, we propose a comprehensive benchmark and an improved baseline. First, we propose CEBench, a new benchmark spanning diverse embodiments in both simulation and the real world with consideration of domain randomization. We collect 14.4k simulated trajectories and 1.6k real-world expert-curated trajectories to support training on CEBench. Second, using CEBench as our testbed, we study three critical aspects of VLAs' practicality and offer several key findings. Informed by these findings, we introduce LLaVA-VLA, a lightweight yet powerful VLA designed for practical deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. Architecturally, it integrates a compact VLM backbone with multi-view perception, proprioceptive tokenization, and action chunking. To eliminate reliance on costly pre-training, LLaVA-VLA adopts a two-stage training paradigm including post-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, LLaVA-VLA extends the action space to unify navigation and manipulation. Experiments across embodiments demonstrate the capabilities of generalization and versatility of LLaVA-VLA , while real-world mobile manipulation experiments establish it as the first end-to-end VLA model for mobile manipulation.

However, their applications and evaluations in autonomous driving remain limited to simulation-based or laboratory settings. The full strength of diffusion models for large-scale, complex real-world settings, such as End-to-End Autonomous Driving (E2E AD), remains underexplored. In this study, we conducted a systematic and large-scale investigation to unleash the potential of the diffusion models as planners for E2E AD, based on a tremendous amount of real-vehicle data and road testing. Through comprehensive and carefully controlled studies, we identify key insights into the diffusion loss space, trajectory representation, and data scaling that significantly impact E2E planning performance. Moreover, we also provide an effective reinforcement learning post-training strategy to further enhance the safety of the learned planner. The resulting diffusion-based learning framework, Hyper Diffusion Planner} (HDP), is deployed on a real-vehicle platform and evaluated across 6 urban driving scenarios and 200 km of real-world testing, achieving a notable 10x performance improvement over the base model.

However, development in the field of robot learning is often slowed by fragmented, closed-source tools designed to only address specific sub-components within the robotics stack.

In addition, the increasing effort in prototyping continuum robots highlights the need to assess the applicability of these models and the necessity of comprehensive performance evaluation. To address this gap, this work investigates the shape reconstruction abilities of a third-order strain interpolation method, examining its ability to capture both individual and combined deformation effects. These results are compared and discussed against the Geometric-Variable Strain approach. Subsequently, simulation results are experimentally verified by reshaping a slender rod while recording the resulting configurations using cameras. The rod configuration is imposed using a manipulator displacing one of its tips and extracted through reflective markers, without the aid of any other external sensor -- i.e. strain gauges or wrench sensors placed along the rod. The experiments demonstrate good agreement between the model predictions and observed shapes, with average error of 0.58% of the rod length and average computational time of 0.32s per configuration, outperforming existing models."}

Diffusion-based policy learning methods have recently become the mainstream approach for robotic manipulation tasks. As grasping is a critical subtask in manipulation, the ability of imitation-learned policies to execute precise and generalizable grasps merits particular attention. Existing imitation learning techniques for grasping often suffer from imprecise grasp executions, limited spatial generalization, and poor object generalization. To address these challenges, we incorporate grasp prior knowledge into the diffusion policy framework. In particular, we employ a latent diffusion policy to guide action chunk decoding with grasp pose prior, ensuring that generated motion trajectories adhere closely to feasible grasp configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised reconstruction objective during diffusion to embed the graspness prior: at each reverse diffusion step, we reconstruct wrist-camera images back-projected the graspness from the intermediate representations. Both simulation and real robot experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods and exhibits strong dynamic grasping capabilities."}

However, their high computational cost remains a major obstacle for real-world applications that require real-time performance. We observe that the actions within a task have varying levels of importance: critical steps demand high precision, while less important ones can tolerate more variance. Leveraging this insight, we propose DySL-VLA, a novel framework that addresses computational cost by dynamically skipping VLA layers based on each action's importance. DySL-VLA categorizes its layers into two types: informative layers, which are consistently executed, and incremental layers, which can be selectively skipped. To intelligently skip layers without sacrificing accuracy, we invent a prior-post skipping guidance mechanism to determine when to initiate layer-skipping. We also propose a skip-aware two-stage knowledge distillation algorithm to efficiently train a standard VLA into a DySL-VLA. Our experiments indicate that DySL-VLA achieves 2.1% improvement in success length over Deer-VLA on the Calvin dataset, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by a factor of 85.7 and providing a 3.75x speedup relative to the RoboFlamingo baseline at iso-accuracy.
