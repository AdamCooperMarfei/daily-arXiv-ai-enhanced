TL;DR: 提出基于视觉姿态估计的直观四足机器人遥操作方法，通过外部摄像头检测操作者手腕位置，实时映射到机械臂控制，结合轨迹规划确保安全操作


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: In hazardous and remote environments, robotic systems perform critical tasks
demanding improved safety and efficiency. Among these, quadruped robots with
manipulator arms offer mobility and versatility for complex operations.
However, teleoperating quadruped robots is challenging due to the lack of
integrated obstacle detection and intuitive control methods for the robotic
arm, increasing collision risks in confined or dynamically changing workspaces.
Teleoperation via joysticks or pads can be non-intuitive and demands a high
level of expertise due to its complexity, culminating in a high cognitive load
on the operator. To address this challenge, a teleoperation approach that
directly maps human arm movements to the robotic manipulator offers a simpler
and more accessible solution. This work proposes an intuitive remote control by
leveraging a vision-based pose estimation pipeline that utilizes an external
camera with a machine learning-based model to detect the operator's wrist
position. The system maps these wrist movements into robotic arm commands to
control the robot's arm in real-time. A trajectory planner ensures safe
teleoperation by detecting and preventing collisions with both obstacles and
the robotic arm itself. The system was validated on the real robot,
demonstrating robust performance in real-time control. This teleoperation
approach provides a cost-effective solution for industrial applications where
safety, precision, and ease of use are paramount, ensuring reliable and
intuitive robotic control in high-risk environments.

*René Zurbrügg,Andrei Cramariuc,Marco Hutter*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于可微分能量公式和优化方法的大规模灵巧抓取数据集生成方法，显著提升了抓取多样性和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抓取数据集生成方法主要依赖采样算法或简化力闭合分析，倾向于产生力量抓取且多样性有限，无法充分利用灵巧手的全部能力

Method: 引入基于二次规划(QP)的严格可微分力闭合能量公式，并提出调整优化方法(MALA*)通过动态拒绝梯度步长来提升性能

Conclusion: 该方法能够合成超越简单力量抓取的大规模、多样化且物理可行的抓取配置，为灵巧抓取研究提供了重要数据基础

Abstract: Dexterous robotic hands enable versatile interactions due to the flexibility
and adaptability of multi-fingered designs, allowing for a wide range of
task-specific grasp configurations in diverse environments. However, to fully
exploit the capabilities of dexterous hands, access to diverse and high-quality
grasp data is essential -- whether for developing grasp prediction models from
point clouds, training manipulation policies, or supporting high-level task
planning with broader action options. Existing approaches for dataset
generation typically rely on sampling-based algorithms or simplified
force-closure analysis, which tend to converge to power grasps and often
exhibit limited diversity. In this work, we propose a method to synthesize
large-scale, diverse, and physically feasible grasps that extend beyond simple
power grasps to include refined manipulations, such as pinches and tri-finger
precision grasps. We introduce a rigorous, differentiable energy formulation of
force closure, implicitly defined through a Quadratic Program (QP).
Additionally, we present an adjusted optimization method (MALA*) that improves
performance by dynamically rejecting gradient steps based on the distribution
of energy values across all samples. We extensively evaluate our approach and
demonstrate significant improvements in both grasp diversity and the stability
of final grasp predictions. Finally, we provide a new, large-scale grasp
dataset for 5,700 objects from DexGraspNet, comprising five different grippers
and three distinct grasp types.

Method: 采用迭代方法，将上下文学习问题表述为基于先前交互预测对参数化策略的调整

Result: 在多个仿真和物理机器人任务中，上下文学习方法在低数据环境下优于其他替代方法

Conclusion: 预训练语言模型的上下文学习能力可以成功应用于动态操作任务，为解决机器人学习中的低数据挑战提供了有效途径

Abstract: Attention-based architectures trained on internet-scale language data have
demonstrated state of the art reasoning ability for various language-based
tasks, such as logic problems and textual reasoning. Additionally, these Large
Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited the ability to perform few-shot
prediction via in-context learning, in which input-output examples provided in
the prompt are generalized to new inputs. This ability furthermore extends
beyond standard language tasks, enabling few-shot learning for general
patterns. In this work, we consider the application of in-context learning with
pre-trained language models for dynamic manipulation. Dynamic manipulation
introduces several crucial challenges, including increased dimensionality,
complex dynamics, and partial observability. To address this, we take an
iterative approach, and formulate our in-context learning problem to predict
adjustments to a parametric policy based on previous interactions. We show
across several tasks in simulation and on a physical robot that utilizing
in-context learning outperforms alternative methods in the low data regime.

Abstract: Wildlife field operations demand efficient parallel deployment methods to
identify and interact with specific individuals, enabling simultaneous
collective behavioral analysis, and health and safety interventions. Previous
robotics solutions approach the problem from the herd perspective, or are
manually operated and limited in scale. We propose a decentralized vision-based
multi-quadrotor system for wildlife monitoring that is scalable, low-bandwidth,
and sensor-minimal (single onboard RGB camera). Our approach enables robust
identification and tracking of large species in their natural habitat. We
develop novel vision-based coordination and tracking algorithms designed for
dynamic, unstructured environments without reliance on centralized
communication or control. We validate our system through real-world
experiments, demonstrating reliable deployment in diverse field conditions.

Abstract: Like mammals, robots must rapidly learn to control their bodies and interact
with their environment despite incomplete knowledge of their body structure and
surroundings. They must also adapt to continuous changes in both. This work
presents a bio-inspired learning algorithm, General-to-Particular (G2P),
applied to a tendon-driven quadruped robotic system developed and fabricated
in-house. Our quadruped robot undergoes an initial five-minute phase of
generalized motor babbling, followed by 15 refinement trials (each lasting 20
seconds) to achieve specific cyclical movements. This process mirrors the
exploration-exploitation paradigm observed in mammals. With each refinement,
the robot progressively improves upon its initial "good enough" solution. Our
results serve as a proof-of-concept, demonstrating the hardware-in-the-loop
system's ability to learn the control of a tendon-driven quadruped with
redundancies in just a few minutes to achieve functional and adaptive cyclical
non-convex movements. By advancing autonomous control in robotic locomotion,
our approach paves the way for robots capable of dynamically adjusting to new
environments, ensuring sustained adaptability and performance.

### [7] [Mag-Match: Magnetic Vector Field Features for Map Matching and Registration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15300)
*William McDonald,Cedric Le Gentil,Jennifer Wakulicz,Teresa Vidal-Calleja*

Main category: cs.RO

TL;DR: Mag-Match是一种基于磁场的3D地图匹配方法，利用磁场高阶导数特征描述器实现无重力对齐的地图配准，在烟雾粉尘等恶劣环境下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于相机或LiDAR的地图匹配方法在烟雾、粉尘等恶劣环境下表现不佳，而磁力计能够检测到其他传感器无法感知的磁场特征，且在这些环境中保持鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Mag-Match方法，基于磁场地图的高阶导数构建特征描述器，具有全局方向不变性；使用物理信息高斯过程进行高效递归概率推理，从点状磁力计数据获取全场高阶导数。

Result: 在仿真和真实实验中与SIFT方法对比，Mag-Match能够实现准确的地图到地图、机器人到地图以及机器人到机器人的变换，无需初始重力对齐。

Conclusion: Mag-Match为恶劣环境下的多会话或多机器人数据集成提供了有效的磁场地图匹配解决方案，突破了传统视觉和几何方法的局限性。

Abstract: Map matching and registration are essential tasks in robotics for
localisation and integration of multi-session or multi-robot data. Traditional
methods rely on cameras or LiDARs to capture visual or geometric information
but struggle in challenging conditions like smoke or dust. Magnetometers, on
the other hand, detect magnetic fields, revealing features invisible to other
sensors and remaining robust in such environments. In this paper, we introduce
Mag-Match, a novel method for extracting and describing features in 3D magnetic
vector field maps to register different maps of the same area. Our feature
descriptor, based on higher-order derivatives of magnetic field maps, is
invariant to global orientation, eliminating the need for gravity-aligned
mapping. To obtain these higher-order derivatives map-wide given point-wise
magnetometer data, we leverage a physics-informed Gaussian Process to perform
efficient and recursive probabilistic inference of both the magnetic field and
its derivatives. We evaluate Mag-Match in simulated and real-world experiments
against a SIFT-based approach, demonstrating accurate map-to-map, robot-to-map,
and robot-to-robot transformations - even without initial gravitational
alignment.

Abstract: The logistics and construction industries face persistent challenges in
automating pallet handling, especially in outdoor environments with variable
payloads, inconsistencies in pallet quality and dimensions, and unstructured
surroundings. In this paper, we tackle automation of a critical step in pallet
transport: the pallet pick-up operation. Our work is motivated by labor
shortages, safety concerns, and inefficiencies in manually locating and
retrieving pallets under such conditions. We present Lang2Lift, a framework
that leverages foundation models for natural language-guided pallet detection
and 6D pose estimation, enabling operators to specify targets through intuitive
commands such as "pick up the steel beam pallet near the crane." The perception
pipeline integrates Florence-2 and SAM-2 for language-grounded segmentation
with FoundationPose for robust pose estimation in cluttered, multi-pallet
outdoor scenes under variable lighting. The resulting poses feed into a motion
planning module for fully autonomous forklift operation. We validate Lang2Lift
on the ADAPT autonomous forklift platform, achieving 0.76 mIoU pallet
segmentation accuracy on a real-world test dataset. Timing and error analysis
demonstrate the system's robustness and confirm its feasibility for deployment
in operational logistics and construction environments. Video demonstrations

TL;DR: SRDrone是一个用于工业级无人机自我精化任务规划的新系统，通过连续状态评估和行为树分层修改，实现了44.87%的成功率提升，最终达到96.25%的实际部署成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖单帧最终状态评估，无法满足连续动态无人机操作的需求，需要开发更鲁棒准确的任务结果评估和反馈机制。

Method: 1. 采用连续状态评估方法，提供鲁棒准确的任务结果判断和解释性反馈；2. 实现分层行为树修改模型，结合多级BT计划分析和约束策略空间，实现结构化反思学习。

Conclusion: SRDrone成功将大语言模型的通用推理智能与无人机严格的物理执行约束相结合，在工业级BT规划框架内嵌入了自适应任务精化能力。

Abstract: We introduce SRDrone, a novel system designed for self-refinement task
planning in industrial-grade embodied drones. SRDrone incorporates two key
technical contributions: First, it employs a continuous state evaluation
methodology to robustly and accurately determine task outcomes and provide
explanatory feedback. This approach supersedes conventional reliance on
single-frame final-state assessment for continuous, dynamic drone operations.
Second, SRDrone implements a hierarchical Behavior Tree (BT) modification
model. This model integrates multi-level BT plan analysis with a constrained
strategy space to enable structured reflective learning from experience.
Experimental results demonstrate that SRDrone achieves a 44.87% improvement in
Success Rate (SR) over baseline methods. Furthermore, real-world deployment
utilizing an experience base optimized through iterative self-refinement
attains a 96.25% SR. By embedding adaptive task refinement capabilities within
an industrial-grade BT planning framework, SRDrone effectively integrates the
general reasoning intelligence of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the
stringent physical execution constraints inherent to embodied drones. Code is

Conclusion: Kitchen-R填补了具身AI研究的关键空白，实现了对语言引导机器人代理更全面和现实的基准测试

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for evaluating progress in robotics and embodied AI.
However, a significant gap exists between benchmarks designed for high-level
language instruction following, which often assume perfect low-level execution,
and those for low-level robot control, which rely on simple, one-step commands.
This disconnect prevents a comprehensive evaluation of integrated systems where
both task planning and physical execution are critical. To address this, we
propose Kitchen-R, a novel benchmark that unifies the evaluation of task
planning and low-level control within a simulated kitchen environment. Built as
a digital twin using the Isaac Sim simulator and featuring more than 500
complex language instructions, Kitchen-R supports a mobile manipulator robot.
We provide baseline methods for our benchmark, including a task-planning
strategy based on a vision-language model and a low-level control policy based
on diffusion policy. We also provide a trajectory collection system. Our
benchmark offers a flexible framework for three evaluation modes: independent
assessment of the planning module, independent assessment of the control
policy, and, crucially, an integrated evaluation of the whole system. Kitchen-R
bridges a key gap in embodied AI research, enabling more holistic and realistic
benchmarking of language-guided robotic agents.

Motivation: 学习型灵巧操作策略经常出现闲置现象，即在某些状态下停止移动，这反映了训练数据的局限性。现有方法如数据过滤或控制频率调整可能对策略性能产生负面影响

Method: PIP方法检测策略闲置状态，并在这些状态施加扰动，帮助策略逃离问题吸引域。该方法无需额外监督或训练

Conclusion: PIP是一种简单有效的策略改进方法，通过利用闲置行为的可检测性来指导探索和策略改进，在关键运动点施加扰动可获得更好的迭代策略改进效果

Abstract: Learning-based methods for dexterous manipulation have made notable progress
in recent years. However, learned policies often still lack reliability and
exhibit limited robustness to important factors of variation. One failure
pattern that can be observed across many settings is that policies idle, i.e.
they cease to move beyond a small region of states when they reach certain
states. This policy idling is often a reflection of the training data. For
instance, it can occur when the data contains small actions in areas where the
robot needs to perform high-precision motions, e.g., when preparing to grasp an
object or object insertion. Prior works have tried to mitigate this phenomenon
e.g. by filtering the training data or modifying the control frequency.
However, these approaches can negatively impact policy performance in other
ways. As an alternative, we investigate how to leverage the detectability of
idling behavior to inform exploration and policy improvement. Our approach,
Pause-Induced Perturbations (PIP), applies perturbations at detected idling
states, thus helping it to escape problematic basins of attraction. On a range
of challenging simulated dual-arm tasks, we find that this simple approach can
already noticeably improve test-time performance, with no additional
supervision or training. Furthermore, since the robot tends to idle at critical
points in a movement, we also find that learning from the resulting episodes
leads to better iterative policy improvement compared to prior approaches. Our
perturbation strategy also leads to a 15-35% improvement in absolute success
rate on a real-world insertion task that requires complex multi-finger
manipulation.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种动态耦合信息的轨迹优化算法，用于自由浮动空间操纵器系统。该算法不仅不避免动态耦合，而是利用其优势来改善轨迹规划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 以前研究主要关注最小化动态耦合，忽视了其潜在优势。本研究认为动态耦合可以被利用来改善轨迹规划效果。

Method: 使用动态耦合矩阵的奇异值分解(SVD)来识别主导耦合行为的组件，形成量化指标来定量评估耦合强度和方向性，并将其整合到轨迹优化框架中。设计滑模控制跟踪控制器来验证轨迹的可行性。

Conclusion: 本研究为自由浮动空间操纵器系统的控制开达了新方向，证明了利用动态耦合而非避免它可以提高系统性能和效率。

Abstract: This study proposes a dynamic coupling-informed trajectory optimization
algorithm for free-floating space manipulator systems (SMSs). Dynamic coupling
between the base and the manipulator arms plays a critical role in influencing
the system's behavior. While prior research has predominantly focused on
minimizing this coupling, often overlooking its potential advantages, this work
investigates how dynamic coupling can instead be leveraged to improve
trajectory planning. Singular value decomposition (SVD) of the dynamic coupling
matrix is employed to identify the dominant components governing coupling
behavior. A quantitative metric is then formulated to characterize the strength
and directionality of the coupling and is incorporated into a trajectory
optimization framework. To assess the feasibility of the optimized trajectory,
a sliding mode control-based tracking controller is designed to generate the
required joint torque inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that explicitly
accounting for dynamic coupling in trajectory planning enables more informed
and potentially more efficient operation, offering new directions for the
control of free-floating SMSs.

Method: 提出NeRD（神经机器人动力学）模型，学习特定机器人的动力学模型，使用机器人中心和空间不变的模拟状态表示，替代传统模拟器的底层动力学和接触求解器。

Conclusion: NeRD为关节刚性体机器人提供了一种通用、可泛化的神经模拟解决方案，成功解决了现有神经模拟器的泛化问题，并展示了在机器人仿真中的实用价值。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of modern robots remains challenging due to
their high degrees of freedom and intricate mechanisms. Neural simulators have
emerged as a promising alternative to traditional analytical simulators,
capable of efficiently predicting complex dynamics and adapting to real-world
data; however, existing neural simulators typically require
application-specific training and fail to generalize to novel tasks and/or
environments, primarily due to inadequate representations of the global state.
In this work, we address the problem of learning generalizable neural
simulators for robots that are structured as articulated rigid bodies. We
propose NeRD (Neural Robot Dynamics), learned robot-specific dynamics models
for predicting future states for articulated rigid bodies under contact
constraints. NeRD uniquely replaces the low-level dynamics and contact solvers
in an analytical simulator and employs a robot-centric and spatially-invariant
simulation state representation. We integrate the learned NeRD models as an
interchangeable backend solver within a state-of-the-art robotics simulator. We
conduct extensive experiments to show that the NeRD simulators are stable and
accurate over a thousand simulation steps; generalize across tasks and
environment configurations; enable policy learning exclusively in a neural
engine; and, unlike most classical simulators, can be fine-tuned from
real-world data to bridge the gap between simulation and reality.
