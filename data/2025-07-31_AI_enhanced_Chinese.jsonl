While soft everting robots have\nbeen widely demonstrated for exploration type tasks, their potential to move\nand deploy payloads in such tasks has been less investigated, with previous\nwork focusing on sensors and tools for the robot. Leveraging the navigation\ncapabilities, and deployed body, of the soft everting robot to deliver payloads\nin hazardous areas, e.g. carrying a water bottle to a person stuck under\ndebris, would represent a significant capability in many applications. In this\nwork, we present an analysis of how soft everting robots can be used to deploy\nlarger, heavier payloads through the inside of the robot. We analyze both what\nobjects can be deployed and what terrain features they can be carried through.\nBuilding on existing models, we present methods to quantify the effects of\npayloads on robot growth and self-support, and develop a model to predict\npayload slip. We then experimentally quantify payload transport using soft\neverting robot with a variety of payload shapes, sizes, and weights and though\na series of tasks: steering, vertical transport, movement through holes, and\nmovement across gaps. Overall, the results show that we can transport payloads\nin a variety of shapes and up to 1.5kg in weight and that we can move through\ncircular apertures with as little as 0.01cm clearance around payloads, carry\nout discrete turns up to 135 degrees, and move across unsupported gaps of 1.15m\nin length.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8f6f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u5371\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8f83\u5927\u3001\u8f83\u91cd\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u8f7d\u8377\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u8f6f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u5c1a\u672a\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u5728\u5371\u9669\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff08\u5982\u6551\u63f4\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91cf\u5316\u4e86\u8f7d\u8377\u5bf9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u751f\u957f\u548c\u81ea\u652f\u6491\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u8f7d\u8377\u6ed1\u52a8\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u5927\u5c0f\u548c\u91cd\u91cf\u7684\u8f7d\u8377\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8fd0\u8f93\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u53ef\u8fd0\u8f93\u591a\u79cd\u5f62\u72b6\u3001\u91cd\u8fbe1.5kg\u7684\u8f7d\u8377\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f0.01cm\u95f4\u9699\u7684\u5b54\u6d1e\u3001\u5b8c\u6210135\u5ea6\u8f6c\u5f2f\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u8de8\u8d8a1.15m\u7684\u65e0\u652f\u6491\u95f4\u9699\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8f6f\u7ffb\u8f6c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5177\u5907\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8fd0\u8f93\u548c\u90e8\u7f72\u8f7d\u8377\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6551\u63f4\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\u3002"}}

We present FLORES (reconfigured wheel-legged robot for enhanced\nsteering and adaptability), a novel wheel-legged robot design featuring a\ndistinctive front-leg configuration that sets it beyond standard design\napproaches. Specifically, FLORES replaces the conventional hip-roll degree of\nfreedom (DoF) of the front leg with hip-yaw DoFs, and this allows for efficient\nmovement on flat surfaces while ensuring adaptability when navigating complex\nterrains. This innovative design facilitates seamless transitions between\ndifferent locomotion modes (i.e., legged locomotion and wheeled locomotion) and\noptimizes the performance across varied environments. To fully exploit FLORES's\nmechanical capabilities, we develop a tailored reinforcement learning (RL)\ncontroller that adapts the Hybrid Internal Model (HIM) with a customized reward\nstructure optimized for our unique mechanical configuration. This framework\nenables the generation of adaptive, multi-modal locomotion strategies that\nfacilitate smooth transitions between wheeled and legged movements.\nFurthermore, our distinctive joint design enables the robot to exhibit novel\nand highly efficient locomotion gaits that capitalize on the synergistic\nadvantages of both locomotion modes.

A simulation of a\ncompact track loader (CTL) with a blade attachment is used to collect data to\ntrain the PINN model.

This requires a safety monitor that is both complete (able to\ndetect all unsafe plans) and sound (does not flag safe plans). In this work, we\npropose a principled safety monitor that leverages modern multi-modal\ntrajectory predictors to approximate forward reachable sets (FRS) of\nsurrounding agents. By formulating a convex program, we efficiently extract\nthese data-driven FRSs directly from the predicted state distributions,\nconditioned on scene context such as lane topology and agent history. To ensure\ncompleteness, we leverage conformal prediction to calibrate the FRS and\nguarantee coverage of ground-truth trajectories with high probability. To\npreserve soundness in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios or under predictor\nfailure, we introduce a Bayesian filter that dynamically adjusts the FRS\nconservativeness based on the predictor's observed performance. We then assess\nthe safety of the ego vehicle's motion plan by checking for intersections with\nthese calibrated FRSs, ensuring the plan remains collision-free under plausible\nfuture behaviors of others.

One of the goals\nof safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing\nwith real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,\nwhere test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a\nquantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios\nmust be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is\nexpressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions\nabout the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while\navoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited\nparameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.\n  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF\nof the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple\nbase distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and\ndifferentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation\nwithout restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,\ncomparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional\nmethod for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational\nresources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.\nAs a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more\nprecise assessment of an ADS's safety.\n  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety.
